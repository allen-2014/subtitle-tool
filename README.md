# subtitle-tool
merging two subtitle files into one subtitle file, which belonging to the same video,including movie, or TV Series etc.

# Problems encounted and Solution
## PS1
when using the end time of subtitle to compare, the result of emerging is bad,
because of the end time not matching the actual time in the video so much,so if 
want to merge exactly, this program hava to use and uses the begin time of 
subtitle, not the end time of it.
## PS2
time bias of two subtitle begin time which belongs to different file each other,
can be the base time bias of two begin time.That's meaning every begin time of each two matching 
subtitles int two files has the same time bias theoretically,but actually not, they may have some little(or big)
difference each other,so how to compute the base time bias reasonably.
this program use the following solution:

step 1:time_biase_list = [time_bias1,time_bias2,time_bias3,time_bias4,time_bias5]
time_biasi = begin timei(of one subtitle file) - begin timei(of the other subtitle file)
i = 1,2,3,...

step 2:base_time_bias = avg(time_biase_list[1:5])

step 3:
time_biase_list.pop(0)
time_biase_list.append(new_time_bias)

step4:goto step 2

as we can see, the base_time_bias changing with time_biase_list updating. That can improve the merging result dramatically.

## PS
when we get base time bias, the threshold
