I wish you wouldn't
do that around me.
It's so filthy!

11
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:03,093
別煩我吧
這是壞習慣
Don't give me a problem
about the cigarettes.
It's such a filthy habit.

12
00:03:03,838 --> 00:03:06,898
老天！看那玩意
Oh, my God!
Look at this.

13
00:03:09,176 --> 00:03:12,444
天啊！
真過份！
Oh, Jesus.
This is so appalling.

14
00:03:14,181 --> 00:03:15,580
難以置信
I can't believe it.

15
00:03:16,183 --> 00:03:18,117
竟然會給他
I can't believe
they gave it to him.

16
00:03:24,525 --> 00:03:28,655
真悲慘
開積架的輸家
Ah, this is pathetic.
Now he's a loser
with a Jaguar.

17
00:03:28,929 --> 00:03:31,659
到底他拍對了誰的馬屁？
Seriously,
who did he have to blow
to get that thing?

18
00:03:34,268 --> 00:03:35,758
早，先生
威利斯早
Good morning, sir.
Mr. Willis.

It's really a...
Mr. Trask!

20
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:40,596
好車
Quite a piece
of machinery.

21
00:03:41,008 --> 00:03:44,603
早，海夫曼
您早，美妙！
Good morning, Havemeyer.
Morning to you, sir.
Bene!

22
00:03:44,945 --> 00:03:47,743
美…妙…
什麼美妙？
Bene?
Bene! Fabulous!
What's fabulous?

23
00:03:47,815 --> 00:03:52,274
您開的那小玩意兒
你覺得我不配？
That fine piece of steel
you have back there.
Ah, you don't think
I deserve it.

24
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,412
不，相反，配得很好
No, sir.
On the contrary.
I think
it's great.

25
00:03:56,957 --> 00:04:00,950
博德的男校長
怎能開破車呢？
Why should the
headmaster of Baird
be seen putt-putting
around in some junker?

26
00:04:01,362 --> 00:04:07,301
我想，董事會諸公
早有此意了吧
In fact, I think the
board of trustees have had
their first true stroke
of inspiration in some time.

27
00:04:07,368 --> 00:04:11,702
謝謝，海夫曼
我照單收下
Well, thank you,
Havemeyer.
I'll take that at face value.

28
00:04:12,173 --> 00:04:13,834
正合我意，先生
I'd expect
nothing less, sir.

29
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:15,998
祝您今天好
Have a good day.

30
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,841
早安，杭賽克太太
早安
Morning,
Mrs. Hunsaker.
Good morning.

31
00:04:20,915 --> 00:04:23,247
這堆是什麼？
殺人犯名單？
What have we here,
Murderer's Row?

32
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:31,313
你們講什麼？
What was that about?

33
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:35,325
沒什麼
和校長打聲招呼而已
Nothing. Just saying hello.
I like to say hello
to Headmaster Trask.

34

不是要去斯朵嗎？
I thought we were
going to Stowe.

36
00:04:41,335 --> 00:04:43,394
「甘蔗叢」就在斯朵
吉米

is Stowe, Jimmy.

37
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:47,534
感恩節在佛蒙特

This year we're
doing it right.
Thanksgiving in Vermont,
Christmas in Switzerland...

38
00:04:47,608 --> 00:04:49,735
去瑞士吉斯達可貴了！
斯達！
Christmas in Gstaad
is gonna cost us...
"Staad."

39
00:04:50,544 --> 00:04:53,012
G不發音，念斯達
喬治？
The "G" is silent.
"Staad." George?

40
00:04:53,414 --> 00:04:57,279
斯達
斯達什麼？
"Staad."
Trent?
"Staad," man.
So what about Staad?

41
00:04:57,351 --> 00:05:01,219
去那兒少說也要三千元
Fine. The "G" may
be silent,
but it's gonna take at least
three grand to get there.

42
00:05:01,555 --> 00:05:03,147
只好打電話給我爸
I'll have to talk
to my father.

43
00:05:03,224 --> 00:05:06,091
最好快點
要他打給我爸爸
Better yet,
have my father
talk to your father.

44
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,218
我爸再打給你爸
Or my father
talk to your father.

45
00:05:10,698 --> 00:05:12,359
週末回家嗎？
You going home
this weekend, Chas?

46
00:05:13,434 --> 00:05:14,765
不一定
I don't know.

47
00:05:15,502 --> 00:05:17,629
你要回他媽的愛達荷？
You going home
to fuckin' Idaho
for Thanksgiving?

48
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:19,365

00:05:22,843 --> 00:05:24,572
想不想去滑雪…
Charlie, how do you
feel about skiing?

51
00:05:26,046 --> 00:05:28,378
徜徉在白茫茫的佛蒙特州？
You in the mood for
the white-bosomed
slopes of Vermont?

52

My father set it up.

53
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:37,254
聖誕節就去瑞士斯達
Christmas
in Switzerland.

54
00:05:37,324 --> 00:05:40,259
分明念「吉斯達」嘛
是你叫我們念「斯達」的
Staad.
Gstaad.
Dropping the "G" is phony.
You said
everybody
says "Staad."

55
00:05:40,327 --> 00:05:43,660
你又沒去過
復活節去百慕達
然後是肯塔基大賽馬
一道去嘛
Not if you've
been there.
Easter in Bermuda,
then Kentucky Derby
weekend.
We could fit
you in, kid.

56
00:05:47,534 --> 00:05:51,197
去「白茫茫的佛蒙特」
要多少錢？
Well, how much are
these white-bosomed
slopes of Vermont?

一千二
含九道大菜和香檳晚餐
1,200.
Includes a nine-course,
champagne
Thanksgiving dinner.

58
00:05:57,945 --> 00:06:00,743
一千二對我而言是多了
$1,200 is a little rich
for my blood, Harry.

59
00:06:01,682 --> 00:06:02,876
你差多少？
Well, how short
are you?

60
00:06:03,751 --> 00:06:08,814
差到你根本不必問
How short, Harry?
So short it wouldn't be
worth the trouble
of you and George to measure.

61
00:06:09,556 --> 00:06:11,547
還是謝謝你的邀請
But thanks for askin',
all right?
Mmm-hmm.

62
00:06:12,626 --> 00:06:14,150
如果你改變心意的話…
If you change
your mind...

63
00:06:14,495 --> 00:06:16,292
何必問他？他靠獎學金的
What'd you do that for?
You know he's on aid.

64

你真臭屁！
You're so
full of shit!

66
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:50,919
羅絲太太！

請進
Come on in.

69
00:07:02,676 --> 00:07:05,941
有沒有粉刺？他痛恨粉刺
Does he got pimples?
He hates pimples.

70
00:07:06,347 --> 00:07:07,746
法蘭絲，安靜點
Francine, be quiet.

71
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:10,543
粉刺，粉刺
Pimples.
Pimples. Yeah.

72
00:07:10,684 --> 00:07:11,673
噓…
Shush!

00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,885
抱歉，我忘了你名字
I'm sorry. The school
gave me your name,
but I've forgotten it.

74
00:07:14,955 --> 00:07:16,286
查理.西門
It's Charlie Simms.

75
00:07:16,357 --> 00:07:18,348
你好嗎？
好
How are you,
Charlie?
Fine, thanks.

76
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:19,218
往這兒
Right this way.

77
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,222
這週末都有空嗎？
You're available
the whole weekend?
Yeah.

78
00:07:27,301 --> 00:07:28,268
不回家過感恩節啊？
不
很好！
Not going home
for Thanksgiving?
No.
Good.

79
00:07:32,497 --> 00:07:35,022
本來他在榮民之家
他不喜歡
They put him in
a veteran's home,
but he hated it,

80
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:37,295
我和爸就接他來了
so I told my dad
that we'd take him.

81
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:42,566
進去以前先聽我說
Before you go in,
do you mind my
telling you a few things?

82
00:07:43,174 --> 00:07:47,167
不要稱他「長官」
別問太多
Don't "sir" him
and don't ask him
too many questions.

83
00:07:47,645 --> 00:07:56,443
他站不起來時，別去扶他
我一看就知道你能勝任
And if he
staggers a little
when he gets up,
don't pay
any attention.
Charlie,
I can tell you're
the right person for the job.

84
00:07:57,255 --> 00:08:03,650
法蘭克舅舅一定會喜歡你
你們要去哪裡
And Uncle Frank's

85
00:08:04,462 --> 00:08:05,861
開車回紐約
We're driving to Albany.

86

87
00:08:15,673 --> 00:08:17,334
要不要湯米出去？
Do you want
Tommy in or out?

88
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:18,134
出去！
Leave him out!

89
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:22,736
他又在追小野貓了…
從路頭追起呢
He's chasing that
Calico ginch from
the track houses again!

90
00:08:28,886 --> 00:08:31,411
其實他甜的跟糖似的
Down deep, the man
is a lump of sugar.

91
00:08:52,043 --> 00:08:52,702
長官？
Sir?

92
00:08:53,444 --> 00:08:54,968
少叫我「長官」
Don't call me sir.

93
00:08:55,513 --> 00:08:58,846
抱歉，我是說「先生」
長官
I'm sorry.
I mean mister, sir.

94
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,577
啊！來了個白癡
不是嗎？
Uh-oh, we got a moron here,
is that it?

95
00:09:02,987 --> 00:09:09,716
不，先生，那…呃…
中尉，是的，長官，中…
No, mister...
That is...

Get in here,

99
00:09:25,676 --> 00:09:28,474
靠近點，我要看清楚
Come a little closer.
I wanna get a
better look at you.

100
00:09:37,688 --> 00:09:38,882
你的皮膚怎樣？
How's your skin, son?

101
00:09:40,825 --> 00:09:41,757
我皮膚，長官？
My skin, sir?

102
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,820
媽呀！上帝！
Oh, for
Christ's sake.

103
00:09:44,095 --> 00:09:46,560
對不起…
叫我法蘭克
I'm sorry, I don...
Just call me Frank.

104
00:09:47,031 --> 00:09:52,764
叫我史雷德先生
或上校，隨你便
就是別叫我長官
Call me Mr. Slade.
Call me Colonel,
if you must. Just don't
call me sir.

105
00:09:54,171 --> 00:09:55,832
好，上校
All right, Colonel.

Graduated to it
from espresso machines.

112
00:10:23,868 --> 00:10:26,996
你呢？患了膽小症
What are you, dying of
some wasting disease?

113
00:10:29,674 --> 00:10:31,471
沒有，我在這兒
No, I'm right...
I'm right here.

114
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:34,734
我知道你站在哪兒

your body is.

115
00:10:35,346 --> 00:10:38,213
我要的是個有腦子的看護
What I'm lookin' for
is some
indication of a brain.

116
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:45,749

詹森總統評福特總統
Too much football

聰明人才能做
你不夠格

Colonel.

124
00:11:11,182 --> 00:11:14,640
爸爸在奧勒岡做什麼的？
What does your daddy do
in Gresham, Oregon?

125
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:15,777
數碎木片？
Hmm?
Count wood chips?

126
00:11:17,388 --> 00:11:21,051
繼父和媽媽開便利商店
My stepfather and my mom
run a convenience store.

127
00:11:21,392 --> 00:11:24,591
真便利
什麼時候開？
How convenient.
What time they open?

128
00:11:25,196 --> 00:11:26,128
早上五點
5:00 a.m.

129
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:26,989
打烊呢？
Close?

130
00:11:27,732 --> 00:11:28,528
凌晨一點
1:00 a.m.

131
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,130
很賣力
Hard workers.

132
00:11:30,801 --> 00:11:32,462
真叫我熱淚盈眶
You got me all
misty-eyed!

133
00:11:37,074 --> 00:11:40,407
那你在這鳥不拉屎
的地方幹嘛
So, what are you doing here
in this sparrow-fart town?

134
00:11:41,145 --> 00:11:42,669
我念博德的
I attend Baird.

135
00:11:44,548 --> 00:11:46,209
念博德
Attend Baird!

136
00:11:47,551 --> 00:11:49,678
我知道你上博德
I know you go
to the Baird school.

137
00:11:50,154 --> 00:11:52,486
問題是，你怎麼上的起？
Point is,
how do you afford it,

138
00:11:53,357 --> 00:11:57,817
靠獎學金和老鄉
努力賣玉米？
even with the student aid
and the folks back home
hustlin' corn nuts?

139
00:11:59,497 --> 00:12:02,694
我還得了
「年輕美國之光」獎學金
I won a Young American
merit scholarship.

140
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:04,498
哇！
Hoo-ah!

141
00:12:06,637 --> 00:12:10,630
榮耀，榮耀屬我主！
Glory, glory
Hallelujah

142
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:14,644
榮耀，榮耀屬我主！
Glory, glory
Hallelujah

143
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:19,377
是誰？
Who's there?

144
00:12:20,518 --> 00:12:22,042
那小不點？
That little
piece of tail?

145
00:12:25,456 --> 00:12:26,787
叫她走開！
Get her outta here!
Yeah.

146
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,731
竟然是我們家的種！
Can't believe
they're my blood.

147
00:12:46,343 --> 00:12:49,676
懶鬼的智商
妖精般的禮貌
IQ of sloths and
the manners of banshees.

148
00:12:50,414 --> 00:12:52,405
她爹是技工，她娘是管家
He's a mechanic,
she's a homemaker.

149
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,282
他很懂車…
He knows as much about cars
as a beauty queen,

150
00:12:55,352 --> 00:12:58,344
而她烤的餅乾脆又香
and she bakes cookies,
taste like wing nuts.

151
00:12:59,156 --> 00:13:02,148
生的孩子，卻是白癡
As for the tots,
they're twits.

152
00:13:02,827 --> 00:13:05,421
你的皮膚如何？
我的助理要能站得出去
How's your skin, son?
I like my aides
to be presentable.

153
00:13:08,966 --> 00:13:13,096
嗯，我有幾顆青春痘…
Well, I...
I've had a few zits.

154
00:13:13,971 --> 00:13:17,907
我室友借我保養霜
他是…
But my roommate,
he lent me his Clinique
because he's from
Chestnut Hill
and he's got...

155
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:20,169
「我的皮膚史」
查理西門著
"The History of My Skin,"
by Charles Simms.

156
00:13:22,246 --> 00:13:23,577
你在唬我？
You patronizing me,
peewee? Hmm?

157
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:28,450
名校的那套馬屁功？
You givin' me
that old prep school
palaver?

158
00:13:29,587 --> 00:13:30,713
博德學院
Baird School!

159
00:13:32,456 --> 00:13:35,857
流著鼻涕
穿蘇格蘭呢的小鬼
A bunch of runny-nosed
snots in tweed jackets

160
00:13:35,926 --> 00:13:38,258
個個想當喬治布希
all studyin'
to be George Bush.
Well...

161
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:45,325
布希總統念的是
安多佛學院吧
I believe President Bush
went to Andover, Colonel.

162
00:13:49,073 --> 00:13:50,734
你挑我毛病？
You sharpshootin'
me, punk?

163
00:13:52,476 --> 00:13:53,807
是不是？
Is that what
you're doin'?

164
00:13:55,479 --> 00:13:57,470
少對我「雞蛋裡挑骨頭」
Don't you
sharpshoot me.

165
00:13:57,815 --> 00:14:02,149
先做四十下伏地挺身
再四十
You'll give me 40.
Then you're gonna give me
40 more.

166
00:14:02,753 --> 00:14:06,018
然後就以為能當重任了？
Then you're gonna
pull K.P.,
the grease pit!

167
00:14:06,757 --> 00:14:10,488
我會按著你的頭浸油槽…
I'll rub your nose
in enlisted men's crud

168
00:14:10,561 --> 00:14:14,224
直到你分不清方向
明白嗎？
till you don't
know which end is up!
You understand?
Yeah.

169
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,967
你要什麼？
您什麼意思？
What do you want?
What do you mean,
what do I want?

170
00:14:20,171 --> 00:14:21,638
你所為何來
What do you want here?

171
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,172
我需要一份工作
I want a job.

172
00:14:27,044 --> 00:14:28,170
一份工作
A job!

173
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:32,909
我好賺錢買機票
回家過聖誕
Yeah, I want a job
so I can make, you know,
my plane fare home
for Christmas.

174
00:14:34,985 --> 00:14:37,977
好，真令人感動
Oh, God,
you're touching!
They used to waltz on the banks
Of the mighty Mississippi
Loving the whole
night through
Till the riverboat gambler
Went off to make a killin'
And bring it on back to you

175
00:15:12,957 --> 00:15:14,424
你還沒走，哭窮鬼？
Still here, poormouth?
Hmm?

176
00:15:17,695 --> 00:15:20,687
便利商店？我的媽！
Convenience store,
my ass!

177
00:15:22,032 --> 00:15:26,025
忙著給老鄉拌調味醬
Hustlin' jalapeno dips
to the appleseeds.

178
00:15:27,238 --> 00:15:28,227
去吧
Go on.

179
00:15:29,573 --> 00:15:30,904
解散
Dismissed.

180
00:15:34,245 --> 00:15:35,576
解散！
Dismissed!
Evangeline
Evangeline
Mrs. Rossi?

181
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,649
查理，我們在這兒呢
上來吧
Charlie, we're up here!
Come on up.

182
00:15:57,464 --> 00:15:59,125
這是唐尼
嗨，查理
This is Donny.
Hey, Charlie.
Hi.

183
00:16:01,468 --> 00:16:06,536
羅絲太太，我搞砸了
不會啦
Mrs. Rossi, I got
the feelin' I screwed up.
Oh, you couldn't have.

184
00:16:07,073 --> 00:16:08,335
面試一團糟
It was a
bad interview.

185
00:16:08,475 --> 00:16:13,071
什麼面試？
只有你來應徵而已
That was no interview,
Charlie. You're it.
You're the only
one that showed up.
You have to take the job.

186
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,675
他睡的多
你可以看電視
打電話給女友
He sleeps a lot. You can
watch television,
call your girlfriend.

187
00:16:18,952 --> 00:16:24,556
輕輕鬆鬆賺三百塊錢
我可不覺得輕鬆
I promise you,
an easy 300 bucks.
I don't get
an easy feeling.

188
00:16:28,361 --> 00:16:30,352
他只是會吼而已
His bark is worse
than his bite.

189
00:16:31,565 --> 00:16:34,762
以前他是大戰英雄
He was a great soldier,
a real hero.

190
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,032
能交心的那種人
The man grows on you.

191
00:16:38,505 --> 00:16:40,302
星期天你們就成哥兒們了
拜託，查理
我和唐尼想去
叔叔卻不想
By Sunday night,
you'll be best friends.
Charlie, please.
I want to get
away with my husband
for a few days,
and Uncle Frank
won't come with us.

192
00:16:50,784 --> 00:16:54,777
六個月前他還看的見光
現在什麼都看不見了
Six months ago,
he could sometimes tell
light from dark,
but now there's nothing.

193
00:16:55,589 --> 00:16:58,581
有人陪他，我比較放心
I just feel better
having someone else
around just in case.

194
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:06,187
拜託？
Please?

195
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,202
好吧，羅絲太太
謝謝你，查理
Okay, Mrs. Rossi.
Sure.
Thank you, Charlie.
Come here, you.
There you go.

196
00:17:26,686 --> 00:17:28,347
小查！等等！
Chas. Chas, hold up.

197
00:17:30,957 --> 00:17:32,618
你好嗎
好
How you doin'?
I'm good.

198
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:33,681
那好
That's great.

199
00:17:34,694 --> 00:17:36,821
這本不能借，是參考書
This can't go out.
This is on reserve.

200
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:41,422
老實說吧
不K這本
老普的課就會當
Here's the thing.
I need the book tonight
for a Thanksgiving quiz
with big-shit Preston
in the morning.

201
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:50,839
我知道
所以他才不准書外借
Yeah, I know.
That's why he
put it on reserve.

202
00:17:50,911 --> 00:17:52,105
館裡只有一本
This is our only copy.

203
00:17:52,178 --> 00:18:02,988
今晚我要熬夜
沒這本書就死定了
早上七點半一定要還來
Chas, I'm pullin'
an all-nighter.
Without that book
I'm dead, okay?
If it's not back
by 7:30, it's gonna
be my ass.

204
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:05,080
沒問題
Oh, I promise.
I promise.
Got it?
Yeah.

205
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,081
等等，我得鎖門
Just a second.
I gotta lock up.
Okay.

206
00:18:40,493 --> 00:18:42,427
真等不及放假走人了！
God, can you wait
to get out of this
dump or what?

207
00:18:48,902 --> 00:18:51,370
你要去哪？「甘蔗包」？
Where you guys
going skiing again?
Sugarloaf or...

208
00:18:51,438 --> 00:18:53,565
是「甘蔗叢」，小查
It's bush, Chas,
Sugarbush.

209
00:19:03,783 --> 00:19:06,843
嘿，我哥兒們哪！
你們在幹嘛？
小聲點！明早再報告
That's my boys.
What are you doin'?
Keep your voice down!
I'll tell you about it
in the morning.
What...

210
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:19,456
杭賽克太太，您好！
Mrs. Hunsaker,
have a nice day?

211
00:19:19,532 --> 00:19:20,863
大呼小叫些什麼
George, why
all the noise?

212
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:24,996
是杭賽克！快走
It's Hunsaker! Go! Go!

213
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:27,798
和小查胡鬧罷了！
I was just
messin' around with Chas.

214
00:19:27,874 --> 00:19:29,671
你好，查理
你好
Good evening, Charles.
Hi, Mrs. Hunsaker.

215
00:19:36,282 --> 00:19:38,273
什麼聲音？
不知道啊
What was that?
I don't know, ma'am.

216
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:40,477
什麼人在那兒啊
天曉得
Who were
those boys?

217
00:19:40,553 --> 00:19:43,021
他們在幹嘛？查理？
Oh, who knows?
What were they doing?
Charles?
Um...

218
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:49,092
您自己織的圍巾嗎？
不，買的
Did you make this
scarf yourself?
No, George,
I bought it.

219
00:19:49,162 --> 00:19:51,892
是嗎？真是漂亮呆了！
謝了
'Cause it's a beauty.
It really is.
Thank you, George.

220
00:19:52,165 --> 00:19:54,827
感恩節前
恐怕再見不到你了…
In case I don't
see you before
the Thanksgiving holidays,

221
00:19:55,368 --> 00:19:58,496
何不給我抱抱？
抱一個嘛
why don't you give me
one of your big hugs?
Oh, George!
Please?

222
00:19:58,571 --> 00:20:00,562
晚安，男士們
抱一個嘛
Good evening, boys.
Come on.
Goodbye,
Mrs. Hunsaker.

223
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:26,025
垂斯克先生
是大無畏的領導
Mr. Trask is our
fearless leader,

224
00:20:27,634 --> 00:20:30,432
好學不倦，囫圇吞棗
a man of learning,
a voracious reader.

225
00:20:32,238 --> 00:20:35,036
能用希腦古文背誦
《伊里亞德》
He could recite the lliad
in ancient Greek

226
00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:39,542
還邊在怒溪邊垂釣鱒魚
while fishing for trout
in a rippling creek.

227
00:20:40,847 --> 00:20:44,713
滿腹經書
料事如神
Endowed with wisdom,
of judgment sound,

228
00:20:45,518 --> 00:20:49,181
然而，有一小小疑問
nevertheless about him
the questions abound.

229
00:20:55,195 --> 00:20:58,858
垂斯克先生何德何能？
How does Mr. Trask
make such wonderful deals?

230
00:20:59,332 --> 00:21:02,995
迷得董事會送他積架跑車？
Why did the trustees
buy him Jaguar wheels?

231
00:21:04,003 --> 00:21:05,595
他不奉承
He wasn't conniving.

232
00:21:06,272 --> 00:21:08,069
更不愚昧
He wasn't crass.

233
00:21:08,408 --> 00:21:10,467
只是噘起小嘴
He merely
puckered his lips

234
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,012
舔他們的屁股
and kissed their ass!

235
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:35,022
來啊
Come on.

236
00:21:35,835 --> 00:21:36,563
再跳
Come on.

237
00:21:41,774 --> 00:21:43,901
再跳一個
One more.
One more, come on!

238
00:22:03,863 --> 00:22:04,852
你媽的！
Fuck you!

239
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,536
西門先生
威利斯先生
Mr. Simms, Mr. Willis.
Hmm.

240
00:22:18,811 --> 00:22:22,872
杭賽克太太說
昨晚你們都在現場
Mrs. Hunsaker says
that you gentlemen
were at a vantage
point last night

241
00:22:22,949 --> 00:22:25,213
也曾親眼目擊…
該負責的人士
to observe who was
responsible for this
stunt.

242
00:22:34,827 --> 00:22:35,623
是誰？
Who was it?

243
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,221
我真的無可奉告，先生
I really couldn't
tell you, sir.

244
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:43,435
我確實看到有人在路燈那兒
I thought I saw
someone fooling
with the lamppost,

245
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:47,970
但再仔細一看，人卻跑了
but by the time
I pulled focus,
they were gone.

246
00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:50,373
西門先生呢？
Mr. Simms?

247
00:22:52,645 --> 00:22:53,976
無可奉告
I couldn't say.

248
00:22:56,516 --> 00:23:00,384
那積架不是我的財產
That automobile
is not just a
possession of mine.

249
00:23:00,453 --> 00:23:05,117
那是董事會交託給我的
That automobile was
presented to me by
the board of trustees.

250
00:23:05,391 --> 00:23:10,727
代表著本校著名的卓越成就
It is a symbol of
the standard of
excellence
for which this
school is known,

251
00:23:10,797 --> 00:23:13,595
我絕不使此精神蒙羞
and I will not
have it tarnished.

252
00:23:14,467 --> 00:23:15,456
那車嗎？
The automobile?

253
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,804
我說的是標準
The standard,
Mr. Willis.

254
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:25,270
你怎麼說，西門先生？
What's your position,
Mr. Simms?

255
00:23:26,512 --> 00:23:27,501
關於哪方面，先生？
On what, sir?

256
00:23:27,747 --> 00:23:29,806
護衛博德的名譽
On preserving the
reputation of Baird.

257
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,614
我絕對支持
I'm for Baird.

258
00:23:32,485 --> 00:23:33,679
那是誰幹的？
Then, who did it?

259
00:23:35,555 --> 00:23:37,079
我不確定
I really
couldn't say for sure.

260
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,285
很好
Very well.

261
00:23:52,108 --> 00:23:56,909
星期一師生委員會要開會
First thing Monday,
I'm convening
a special session
of the student-faculty
disciplinary committee.

262
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:02,714
既然此事件關乎全校
全體學生都要出席
As this is a matter
which concerns
the whole school,
the entire student body
will be present.

263
00:24:02,786 --> 00:24:05,448
當天不上課、不舉行活動
There will be
no classes,
no activities.

264
00:24:05,555 --> 00:24:07,682
一切取消
Nothing will
transpire at
this institution

265
00:24:08,058 --> 00:24:10,652
直到判決確認
until that proceeding
is concluded.

266
00:24:13,196 --> 00:24:16,188
如果屆時沒有任何進展
And if, at that time,
we are no further
along than we are now,

267
00:24:18,602 --> 00:24:20,126
兩位就被開除
I will expel you both.

268
00:24:25,742 --> 00:24:28,540
威利斯先生，請先離開
Mr. Willis,
would you excuse us?

269
00:24:32,949 --> 00:24:33,881
感恩節快樂
Have a nice Thanksgiving.

270
00:24:36,353 --> 00:24:37,684
你也一樣，威利斯先生
Thank you.
You, too, Mr. Willis.

271
00:24:37,887 --> 00:24:38,876
我會的
I will.

272
00:24:46,963 --> 00:24:48,294
西門先生
Mr. Simms,

273
00:24:50,767 --> 00:24:52,894
我的話還沒說完
I'm not quite through
with you yet.

274
00:25:01,778 --> 00:25:09,976
本職位的好處之一是
我有權決定一些校務
One of the few perks
of this office is that
I am empowered to handle
certain matters on
my own as I see fit.

275
00:25:11,488 --> 00:25:12,477
明白嗎？
Do you understand?

276
00:25:13,323 --> 00:25:14,654
是的，先生
很好
Yes, sir.
Good.

277
00:25:15,191 --> 00:25:17,989
我和哈佛大學正在談合作
The Dean of
Admissions at Harvard
and I have an arrangement.

278
00:25:18,528 --> 00:25:23,261
除了一般博德申請學生
Along with the usual
sheaf of applicants
submitted by Baird,
of which virtually

279
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,666
會有三分之二被錄取外
我能再加一名
two-thirds are
guaranteed admittance,
I add one name,

280
00:25:31,207 --> 00:25:35,007
一名優秀
但環境不好的學生
somebody who's a standout
and yet underprivileged.

281
00:25:36,146 --> 00:25:40,276
一名付不起
劍橋學雜費的學生
A student who
cannot afford to pay
the board and
tuition in Cambridge.

282
00:25:42,886 --> 00:25:46,481
你知道今年被提名的人
是誰嗎？
Do you know on whose behalf
I drafted a memo this year?

283
00:25:47,524 --> 00:25:48,183
不知道
No, sir.

284
00:25:48,825 --> 00:25:49,484
你
You.

285
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,018
你，西門先生
You, Mr. Simms.

286
00:25:55,699 --> 00:25:57,564
現在你總該告訴我
是誰幹的吧？
Now can you tell me
who did it?

287
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:01,696
不，先生，我不能
No, sir, I can't.

288
00:26:03,373 --> 00:26:06,035
週末想清楚再說
You take the weekend
to think about it, Mr. Simms.

289
00:26:08,712 --> 00:26:09,701
再會
Good afternoon.

290
00:26:13,717 --> 00:26:14,581
他說什麼？
What'd he say?

291
00:26:15,518 --> 00:26:17,179
沒什麼
什麼意思？
Nothin'.
What do you
mean, nothing?

292
00:26:17,654 --> 00:26:19,986
重講一遍對我們講的話
He said the
same thing.
He just said
it over.

293
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:25,184
你知道他在幹嘛？
在搞分化啊！
You know what
he's doing?
He's good-cop,
bad-coppin' us.

294
00:26:25,528 --> 00:26:27,792
我是主流，你是非主流
He knows I'm old guard.
You're fringe.

295
00:26:27,864 --> 00:26:30,526
他要打壓我，再哄騙你
He's gonna bear down on me
and soft-soap you.

296
00:26:31,868 --> 00:26:35,201
他有沒有哄你？有沒有？
Did he try to
soft-soap you?
Did he?

297
00:26:36,673 --> 00:26:37,332
沒有
No.

298
00:26:38,942 --> 00:26:41,604
顯然你嚇壞了，有沒有？
Chas, I detect a slight
panic pulse from you.
Are you panicking?

299
00:26:42,078 --> 00:26:43,067
一點點
Yeah, a little.

300
00:26:43,546 --> 00:26:45,878
別慌，你拿獎學金的對吧？
Come on.
You're on
scholarship, right?
Yeah.

301
00:26:48,017 --> 00:26:51,350
你拿獎學金從奧勒岡來博德
You're on scholarship
from Oregon at Baird.

302
00:26:52,555 --> 00:26:54,614
離家可是幾百哩，小查
You're a long way
from home, Chas.

303
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:57,286
什麼意思？
What's that got
to do with anything?

304
00:26:58,161 --> 00:27:00,152
我不知道你們那兒的習慣…
I don't know how
it works out there.

305
00:27:00,497 --> 00:27:03,159
在這兒，我們很團結
But how it
works here?
We stick together.

306
00:27:04,167 --> 00:27:05,964
我們對他們，絕不變卦
It's us against them,
no matter what.

307
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:10,232
既不出賣朋友
也不告訴父母
We don't cover our ass.
We don't tell our parents.

308
00:27:10,507 --> 00:27:12,372
個個守口如瓶
Stonewall everybody!

309
00:27:13,376 --> 00:27:14,434
最重要的是…
And above all,

310
00:27:15,178 --> 00:27:17,373
絕對、絕對…
never, ever

311
00:27:18,114 --> 00:27:21,106
不能背棄任何一個哥兒們
leave any of us
twisting in the wind.

312
00:27:23,052 --> 00:27:24,041
就這樣
And that's it.

313
00:27:24,854 --> 00:27:27,516
這些和我拿獎學金
有關係嗎？
What does that have
to do with me being
on scholarship?
Hey, hey.

314
00:27:29,793 --> 00:27:32,125
我只是把情況分析給你聽
I'm just tryin' to
bring you up to speed,
kid, that's it.

315
00:27:33,263 --> 00:27:34,059
謝了
Thanks.

316
00:27:37,734 --> 00:27:41,397
這樣吧
給我幾小時想對策
I'll tell you what.
Give me a few hours
to figure out the moves,

317
00:27:42,071 --> 00:27:43,732
然後打到維州找我
and call me tonight
in Vermont.

318
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:48,875
我都在「甘蔗叢」別墅
好嗎？
I'll be at
the Sugarbush lodge,
all right?

319
00:27:48,945 --> 00:27:49,604
好吧
All right.

320
00:27:51,481 --> 00:27:52,470
你還好吧？
You all right?

321
00:27:54,017 --> 00:27:55,348
過得去吧
Yeah, I guess so.
Okay.

322
00:28:01,157 --> 00:28:03,284
別讓他每天喝超過四杯
Try to keep him down
to four drinks a day.

323
00:28:03,393 --> 00:28:06,191
別讓他超過四十杯
就不錯啦
If you can keep
him down to 40,
you're doin' good.

324
00:28:06,362 --> 00:28:08,762
你會在酒裡摻水吧？
We try to water
them down a little.
Do you know how to do that?

325
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,493
該走了，親愛的
It's a long ride,
honey.

326
00:28:11,634 --> 00:28:13,295
先搬行李吧，我馬上來
Get the bags in the car.
I'll be right out.

327
00:28:13,369 --> 00:28:26,048
媽咪，別忘了叔公要散步
你每天要帶他出去透透氣
Mommy, Mommy,
don't forget
Uncle Frank's walk.
Oh, yeah.
You have to air him
out a little every day.

328
00:28:28,051 --> 00:28:30,042
你要不要先回他那兒
Why don't you
go on back there,
get yourself oriented?

329
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:33,111
我馬上過來
給你聯絡電話號碼
I'll come out in a minute,
give you telephone
numbers and stuff.

330
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:39,392
我絕不會貿然動作的
Well, I wouldn't
try a thing like that
unless I knew, would I?

331
00:28:40,129 --> 00:28:41,323
我來跟她說吧
Just let me
speak to her.

332
00:28:42,332 --> 00:28:46,530
嗨，美人，是你嗎？
昨天我們講過話
Hello, beautiful.
Is that you?
Yeah,
we spoke yesterday.

333
00:28:49,138 --> 00:28:51,606
午飯喝酒了嗎？
聲音好有磁性
You have a glass
of wine with lunch?
You sound
a little dusky. Hmm.

334
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:56,677
等一下，甜心
Just a minute,
sweetheart.

335
00:28:58,948 --> 00:28:59,937
你回來了？
You're back, huh?

336
00:29:01,551 --> 00:29:06,219
死硬派
取我的藍制服…
櫥子裡的西裝夾裡
Tenacious!
Get out my dress blues.
They're in a garment bag
in the closet.

337
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:10,749
肩章在梳妝台上…
扣上去
Check the
top dresser drawer.
Take out
the shoulder boards
and affix them,
shoulders
right and left,

338
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,628
盡快，立刻！
ASAP. That means now.

339
00:29:14,898 --> 00:29:18,231
抱歉害你久等
Hello.
Sorry to keep you
waiting, sweetheart.

340
00:29:19,435 --> 00:29:21,960
我不喜歡催人…
I'm not the kind of guy
who likes to rush things,

341
00:29:22,038 --> 00:29:24,768
但是我要坐四點的飛機…
but I'm catchin'
a 4:00 at Logan,
I'm lookin' out my window,

342
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:26,832
現在連輛禮車也沒看到
and there's
not a taxi in sight.

343
00:29:28,177 --> 00:29:34,915
傑特還捨不得投資
買無線電嗎
那叫司機來聽吧
What happened
to Chet?
He didn't invest
in a radio yet?
Hah! Well,
get your driver on it.

344
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:38,310
叫他快點
Tell him to get
a move on.
Yes. Mmm.

345
00:29:42,325 --> 00:29:45,522
這等「臥室嗓音」
配的身材一定好
Some kind of body
has got to go with
that bedroom voice.

346
00:29:46,062 --> 00:29:48,394
哪天要去好好瞧瞧
One day I'm gonna swing by,
get a better look at it.

347
00:29:49,198 --> 00:29:49,994
一定
You bet.
Bye.

348
00:29:56,272 --> 00:29:59,264
提袋在床底下，拿出來
My Valpak's
underneath the bed.
Get it out.

349
00:29:59,876 --> 00:30:02,208
制服放進去
Put the boards
on the blues
and fold 'em in.

350
00:30:03,613 --> 00:30:05,410
我們要去哪兒嗎，中校？
Are we going
someplace, Colonel?

351
00:30:06,282 --> 00:30:07,749
關你什麼事？
What business is
that of yours?

352
00:30:08,618 --> 00:30:10,609
別聳肩，小子，我看不見
Don't shrug, imbecile.
I'm blind.

353
00:30:10,687 --> 00:30:13,087
「身體語言」留給小妞兒們吧
Save your body language
for the bimbi.

354
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,551
快去整理我的行李
Now, get my gear out.
Francine, get in the car.

355
00:30:19,495 --> 00:30:23,226
快三點了
原始人還沒出洞呢
It's almost 3:00.
The goddamn Flintstones
haven't left yet.
Willie Rossi
must go in the car.

356
00:30:28,638 --> 00:30:29,969
羅絲太太來了
Here comes
Mrs. Rossi now.

357
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:30,967
媽的！
Damn it!

358
00:30:32,308 --> 00:30:34,503
今天她已經道別三次了
She said goodbye to me
three times today.

359
00:30:35,778 --> 00:30:37,837
怎麼搞的？
她有分離焦慮症？
What has she got,
separation anxiety?

360
00:30:38,181 --> 00:30:39,648
別讓她進門
Cut her off
at the door.

361
00:30:42,852 --> 00:30:44,649
嗨，親愛的，拜拜，親愛的
Hi, honey.
Bye, honey.

362
00:30:49,018 --> 00:30:50,007
真希望你一起去
I wish you were
coming with us.

363
00:30:51,287 --> 00:30:53,482
我也希望，下次吧
Me, too.
Maybe next time.

364
00:30:58,828 --> 00:31:05,097
小心開車
我們會在這裡
Drive carefully now.
Yeah.
Charlie, this is
where we'll be.

365
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:09,363
祝好運，別讓他喝太多
Good luck, Charlie.
Don't let him
drink too much.

366
00:31:13,776 --> 00:31:14,765
再見，查理
See you, Charlie.

367
00:31:16,112 --> 00:31:19,240
別讓他打色情專線
他喜歡講髒話
And no 000 numbers.
He loves to talk dirty.

368
00:31:27,457 --> 00:31:28,788
開始工作吧
All right,
let's get to work.

369
00:31:38,735 --> 00:31:40,259
不會扣那個？
L- buckles
givin' you trouble?

370
00:31:42,672 --> 00:31:44,333
沒參加過童子軍
小帥哥？
Never in the
Boy Scouts, sluggo?

371
00:31:45,007 --> 00:31:46,668
我是童子軍新手
I made Tenderfoot.

372
00:31:46,743 --> 00:31:48,142
新手、新腳
Tenderfoot,
my foot!

373
00:31:48,811 --> 00:31:52,611
便利店媽咪的寶寶
我來看看
Convenience store
mama's boy.
Here. Let me
take a look
at that.

374
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,147
敢再碰我我就宰你
小雜種
Touch me again,
I'll kill you,
you little son of a bitch!

375
00:31:58,621 --> 00:32:00,145
只有我能碰你
I touch you.

376
00:32:02,158 --> 00:32:03,147
懂嗎？
Understand?

377
00:32:05,828 --> 00:32:09,821
肩章在最上一格，快去拿
My shoulder boards are
in the top dresser drawer.
Get them, son.

378
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,491
有銀橡樹葉的那對
是這些…？
The epaulets with
the silver oak leaf.
Are these the...

379
00:32:32,655 --> 00:32:34,452
對，車還沒來？
Good.
Taxi come yet?

380
00:32:35,925 --> 00:32:37,256
中校，我們去哪裡？
Colonel,
where are we going?

381
00:32:38,394 --> 00:32:41,727
去哪裡？去看畸形人展
Where are we going?
Freak show central.

382
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,722
在哪裡？
紐約市
Where's that?
New York City.

383
00:32:47,603 --> 00:32:50,128
在紐約州
羅絲太太沒告訴我
That's in New York, son.
New York State.
Mrs. Rossi didn't say
anything to me
about going anywhere.

384
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:54,999
她忘了
She forgot.

385
00:32:56,879 --> 00:33:00,474
要不要打給她…
你開玩笑啊！
Should we call her,
'cause I...
You kidding me?

386
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:03,815
他們開著那小破車到阿伯尼時
Call her? By the time
they get to Albany
in that Hupmobile
he drives

387
00:33:03,886 --> 00:33:06,548
大賽馬早開幕了
it'll be opening day
at Saratoga.

388
00:33:06,622 --> 00:33:08,283
我不能去紐約市
Colonel, I can't go
to New York City.

389
00:33:08,357 --> 00:33:09,346
為什麼不能？
Why not?

390
00:33:10,827 --> 00:33:14,354
責任太大
New York...
New York's too
much responsibility.

391
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:16,295
算了吧，責任！
Ah, responsibility!

392
00:33:16,499 --> 00:33:21,692
我排上有好多小男生
都靠我照顧他們
走吧
I had a lot
of 17-year-olds
in my first platoon.
I took care of them.
All set!

393
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,234
我看起來如何？
How do I look?

394
00:33:27,176 --> 00:33:30,634
機票，錢，演講稿
Tickets. Money.
Speech.

395
00:33:31,514 --> 00:33:34,642
老笑話一則
詹森時代流行的
Old Washington joke
from my days with Lyndon.

396
00:33:37,253 --> 00:33:40,245
我就知道能信得過交通車
你好了？
I knew I could
count on transportation.
Are you ready?

397
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:46,057
這兒不是板門店
一句「是」就能成事
This is not Panmunjom.
A simple yes will do.

398
00:33:47,396 --> 00:33:50,388
好，拿著，動作要快
Um...
Good! Here you go.
Come on!
Hop to, son!

399
00:33:51,934 --> 00:33:53,731
到我前面，我們走
You're in front of me.
Let's go.

400
00:33:55,471 --> 00:33:57,063
湯姆斯特，快來
Tomster,
come here, boy.

401
00:33:59,342 --> 00:34:00,138
快來
Come on.

402
00:34:00,676 --> 00:34:04,669
湯姆斯特，湯姆斯特…
Here, Tomster, come on.
Tomster, Tomster. Yeah.

403
00:34:06,148 --> 00:34:06,944
記著…
有疑問的時候…
就去做愛
Remember, when in doubt,
fuck.

404
00:34:14,423 --> 00:34:16,618
飛到哪兒，先生？
Good afternoon, sir.
Where's our destination?

405
00:34:16,692 --> 00:34:20,219
紐約市，勇者之家
Our destination
New York City,
home of the brave!

406
00:34:20,296 --> 00:34:21,957
兩位普通艙飛紐約
We got two for
the shuttle
to New York.

407
00:34:22,031 --> 00:34:24,966
我才不「普通」呢
我們是頭等艙
I'm not shuttling anywhere.
Look at those tickets.
First class.

408
00:34:25,034 --> 00:34:26,501
是，頭等艙
Yes, sir,
first class.

409
00:34:26,836 --> 00:34:30,636
你替我買票了？
我沒說過要去紐約啊
Colonel,
you bought me
a ticket?
I never said I'd
go to New York.

410
00:34:30,706 --> 00:34:34,506
你是只敢照規矩做的膽小鬼？
What are you,
some kind of
chicken-shit,
sticks to job
description only?

411
00:34:34,977 --> 00:34:36,171
46號登機門，先生
Gate 46, sir.

412
00:34:36,846 --> 00:34:38,313
謝啦，士官長
As you were, son.
Thank you, sir.

413
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:40,975
門在哪裡？
Which way's the door?

414
00:34:42,585 --> 00:34:46,578
你瞎了？你瞎了嗎？
當然沒有
Are you blind?
Are you blind?
Of course not.

415
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:49,181
那你媽的猛抓我手幹嘛？
Then why do you keep grabbin'
my goddamn arm?

416
00:34:49,992 --> 00:34:51,983
我才能抓你的手！
I take your arm.

417
00:34:56,732 --> 00:35:03,463
對不起
別對不起了，不知者無罪
你一輩子大概都在看MTV
好啊！
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.
How would you know,
watchin' MTV all your life?
Gentlemen?
Yeah!

418
00:35:06,142 --> 00:35:08,337
傑克丹尼爾
好！
Jack Daniels.
You bet.

419
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,546
低卡汽水
And Diet Slice.

420
00:35:12,014 --> 00:35:13,276
低卡汽水
The old Diet Slice.

421
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:26,356
再加一杯水
謝謝你，黛芬妮
不客氣，先生
你怎麼知道她名字？
And a water.
Thank you,
Daphne.
Certainly, sir.
Mmm!
How did you
know her name?

422
00:35:28,898 --> 00:35:31,628
嗯，她擦「芙蕾絲」
Well, she's
wearin' Floris.

423
00:35:32,501 --> 00:35:34,093
英國香水
That's an
English cologne.

424
00:35:35,638 --> 00:35:38,971
但是她又有加州腔
But her voice is
California chickie.

425
00:35:39,709 --> 00:35:42,906
加州小妞嚮往英國淑女
Now, California chickie
bucking for English lady.

426
00:35:43,646 --> 00:35:44,840
所以我叫她黛芬妮
I call her Daphne.

427
00:35:47,316 --> 00:35:51,309
你那小玩意兒
可能會大幹一場
Oh, big things may
happen to that
little thing of yours.

428
00:35:53,322 --> 00:35:54,186
中校…
Look, Colonel,

429
00:35:56,325 --> 00:35:57,792
我陪你去紐約
I'll get you to New York,
all right?
Uh-huh.

430
00:35:58,461 --> 00:36:00,452
然後我就立刻回來
Then I'm gonna have
to turn around and come back.

431
00:36:02,064 --> 00:36:03,929
做你應當做的，查兒
Well, Chuck,
you gotta do
what you gotta do.

432
00:36:05,201 --> 00:36:08,193
叫我查理，或查爾斯
Charlie, all right?
Or Charles.

433
00:36:08,537 --> 00:36:11,870
抱歉，不能怪你
查兒是…
Sorry.
I can't blame you, though.
Chuck is a...

434
00:36:16,078 --> 00:36:17,602
我們為什麼去紐約？
So, why are we
going to New York?

435
00:36:18,414 --> 00:36:21,349
不重要的事你不需要知道
All information will be given
on a need-to-know basis.
Hoo-ah!

436
00:36:25,287 --> 00:36:27,278
黛芬妮呢？找她過來吧
Where's Daphne?
Let's get her down here.

437
00:36:30,493 --> 00:36:31,551
她在後面
She's in the back.

438
00:36:32,561 --> 00:36:34,028
小尾巴在「尾巴」呢
A tail's in the tail.
Hah!

439
00:36:37,633 --> 00:36:39,294
但是我一樣聞得到她
Oh, but I still smell her.

440
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:43,698
女人…
Women.

441
00:36:45,574 --> 00:36:46,700
能怎麼說呢？
What can you say?

442
00:36:48,711 --> 00:36:49,700
誰創造她們的？
Who made 'em?

443
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,371
上帝真他媽的是天才
God must have been
a fuckin' genius.

444
00:36:58,254 --> 00:36:59,243
秀髮
The hair...

445
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,719
秀髮是最重要的部份
They say the hair
is everything, you know.

446
00:37:05,261 --> 00:37:09,197
有沒有把鼻子
埋在一堆雲鬢中…
Have you ever
buried your nose
in a mountain of curis

447
00:37:09,265 --> 00:37:12,723
然後希望就此睡去的經驗？
and just wanted
to go to sleep forever?

448
00:37:14,336 --> 00:37:15,928
還有香唇
Or lips,

449
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,131
輕輕黏上你的…
and when they touched,
yours were like

450
00:37:20,209 --> 00:37:23,667
就像越過沙漠後
that first swallow of wine

451
00:37:23,946 --> 00:37:25,675
喝下的第一口美酒
after you just crossed
the desert.

452
00:37:29,952 --> 00:37:30,941
乳房
Tits!
Hoo-ah.

453
00:37:33,622 --> 00:37:35,954
大的，小的…
Big ones, little ones,

454
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:41,425
乳頭瞪著你
像秘密探照燈
nipples staring
right out at you
like secret searchlights.
Mmm.

455
00:37:46,435 --> 00:37:47,424
還有腿…
And legs...

456
00:37:49,171 --> 00:37:52,368
不管是不是符合黃金比例
I don't care if
they're Greek columns

457
00:37:52,575 --> 00:37:54,566
或像二手貨的史坦威鋼琴
or secondhand Steinways.

458
00:37:56,045 --> 00:37:57,103
兩腿中間的…
What's between 'em,

459
00:37:59,582 --> 00:38:01,243
正是通往天堂的護照
passport to heaven.

460
00:38:03,052 --> 00:38:04,178
我得喝一杯
I need a drink.

461
00:38:08,524 --> 00:38:10,185
是的，西門先生
Yes, Mr. Simms,

462
00:38:11,927 --> 00:38:16,455
這世上只有兩個字動聽…
there's only two syllables
in this whole wide
world worth hearing.

463
00:38:21,737 --> 00:38:22,533
陰部
Pussy.
Hah!

464
00:38:26,008 --> 00:38:28,533
你有沒有在聽？
這可是智慧結晶
Are you listening to me, son?
I'm givin' you pearis here.

465
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,544
你真的很喜歡女人
勝於一切
I guess you
really like women.
Oh, above all things!

466
00:38:41,023 --> 00:38:44,686
遠次於女人，排名第二的
A very, very
distant second

467
00:38:46,562 --> 00:38:47,893
是法拉利跑車
is a Ferrari.

468
00:38:55,574 --> 00:38:56,563
查理
Charlie?

469
00:38:59,578 --> 00:39:00,636
給我你的手
Give me your hand.

470
00:39:03,248 --> 00:39:05,978
此乃你教育的開始
「華爾道夫大飯店」
This is just the start
of your education, son.
Hoo-ah.

471
00:39:23,802 --> 00:39:24,791
我們在哪裡？
Where are we?

472
00:39:25,203 --> 00:39:26,192
我們在哪裡？
Where are we, eh?

473
00:39:27,272 --> 00:39:30,264
一切文明的中心
The cynosure of
all things civilized.

474
00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:32,270
華爾道夫大飯店
The Waldorf-Astoria.

475
00:39:33,678 --> 00:39:37,205
上次是和布魯塞爾同事
一起來的
The last time I
was here, Charlie,
was with a G-2 from Brussels.

476
00:39:37,282 --> 00:39:38,408
他有部法拉利
Had a Ferrari.

477
00:39:39,017 --> 00:39:43,750
每天我都幫他開車門
他竟然沒邀我兜過風
Every day I
held the door open
for the fucker.
Never even
offered me a ride.

478
00:39:44,289 --> 00:39:45,278
去他的
Well, fuck him.

479
00:39:46,358 --> 00:39:47,825
他死了，我瞎了
He's dead and I'm blind.

480
00:39:52,364 --> 00:39:56,698
幫我找個妞兒
Spread the word.
Thank you, sir.
And the intelligence
will be forthcoming?

481
00:39:57,168 --> 00:39:57,964
什麼？
Sir?

482
00:39:58,436 --> 00:39:59,630
找個妞兒
是的，歡迎光臨華爾道夫
On the
escort scene.
Yes, sir.
And welcome to
the Waldorf.

483
00:40:05,009 --> 00:40:06,203
多謝，朋友
Gracias, amigo.

484
00:40:08,146 --> 00:40:11,604
波多黎各人
是最好的陸戰隊
Puerto Ricans.
Always made
the best infantrymen.
Oh!

485
00:40:27,232 --> 00:40:28,563
又回家啦！
I'm home again.

486
00:40:29,567 --> 00:40:31,091
給我來點酒
Give me an inventory
on this, will you?

487
00:40:37,909 --> 00:40:39,638
我在哪？亞洲嗎？
All right, where am I,
in Asia?

488
00:40:40,178 --> 00:40:42,772
他說電話在房間另一頭
He told me the phone
was on the other side
of the room, didn't he?

489
00:40:42,981 --> 00:40:43,970
在那兒呢？
By the windows?

490
00:40:45,984 --> 00:40:46,973
在這裡
It's right here.
Okay.

491
00:40:51,189 --> 00:40:52,520
咱們上路啦
We're in business.

492
00:40:57,462 --> 00:40:58,520
請接橡樹廳
Get me the Oak Room.

493
00:41:00,532 --> 00:41:01,726
酒夠嗎？
只有吉米賓和早時年兩種
How's that inventory
comin'?
There's Jim Beam
and Early Times.

494
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:10,736
補給官又給收買了！
Quartermaster's
on the take again.

495
00:41:11,409 --> 00:41:14,401
薛登或麥克在嗎？
Hello. Is Sheldon
or Mack there?

496
00:41:15,947 --> 00:41:18,074
我是法蘭克史雷德中校
This is Lieutenant
Colonel Frank Slade.

497
00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:21,682
以前是常客
和巴將軍來過
I used to be a regular.
I used to come in
with a General Garbisch.

498
00:41:24,222 --> 00:41:26,952
大概是因為他現在住地府吧
Yes, that's
probably because he's at
Arlington, six feet under.

499
00:41:27,025 --> 00:41:31,894
我要一張桌子，兩個人
別靠廚房，八點十五
Listen up.
I want a table for two,
and I don't mean Siberia,
15.

500
00:41:33,498 --> 00:41:35,227
把瓶子清掉
Clear them little
bottles off.

501
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:39,100
我打完電話
你就叫海曼來
And when I get
off the phone,
call up Hyman.

502
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:45,304
我要滿滿一房間的
「約翰丹尼爾」
你是說「傑克丹尼爾」？
Tell him I want it
wall to wall
with John Daniels.
Don't you mean
Jack Daniels?

503
00:41:45,577 --> 00:41:48,444
熟客才這麼叫的
He may be Jack to you, son.
But when you've known him
as long as I have...

504
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,039
是玩笑
這是史中校
八點我要轎車
That's a joke. Hello!
This is Lieutenant
Colonel Frank Slade.
I would like a limo,
00.

505
00:42:02,393 --> 00:42:03,325
你要喝什麼？
What are you drinkin'?

506
00:42:04,395 --> 00:42:07,125
不用，謝謝，我不喝酒
Nothing, thanks.
I don't use it.

507
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:08,930
那有什麼「用」？
What's useful about it?

508
00:42:11,069 --> 00:42:14,061
中校，我要走了
I don't know.
Listen, Colonel,
I have to get going.

509
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,204
走去哪？
Where you goin'?

510
00:42:16,741 --> 00:42:20,006
回學校
有很重要的事要做
Back to school.
I've got some real
important stuff I
have to take care of.

511
00:42:21,813 --> 00:42:22,802
好啊
Very well.

512
00:42:24,415 --> 00:42:26,747
但我從不讓助理餓著走
But I never let
my aides leave
on an empty stomach.

513
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:31,555
吃完晚餐
我司機會送你
You'll dine with me
and then my driver
will transport you

514
00:42:31,623 --> 00:42:34,217
往波士頓的飛機十點起飛
to the airport for
the Boston shuttle
departing at 2200 hours.

515
00:42:35,827 --> 00:42:39,160
現在，打開我的行李箱
Meanwhile,
unpack my bag.

516
00:42:39,697 --> 00:42:41,221
我要上廁所
I'm gonna christen
the latrine.

517
00:42:43,902 --> 00:42:44,960
你叫什麼，司機？
What's your name,
driver?

518
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:46,429
曼尼，先生
Manny, sir.

519
00:42:46,704 --> 00:42:51,368
華爾道夫的小廝…
這裡的小妞好不好？
Manny. The bellhops
at the Waldorf,
are they any good
at getting escorts?

520
00:42:52,043 --> 00:42:53,169
我不知道，先生
I wouldn't know, sir.

521
00:42:54,045 --> 00:42:55,034
那你知道什麼？
What would you know?

522
00:42:55,647 --> 00:42:56,579
哪方面的？
About what?

523
00:42:57,582 --> 00:42:58,640
你知道哪方面？
About you-know-what?

524
00:43:01,052 --> 00:43:02,644
你知道我能做點安排
Maybe I could
manage something.

525
00:43:03,388 --> 00:43:05,117
我要的可是一流的
I'm talkin'
top of the line, now.

526
00:43:05,924 --> 00:43:07,255
我想一想，先生
Let me think
about this, sir.

527
00:43:16,334 --> 00:43:17,460
你怎麼回事？
What's the matter
with you?

528
00:43:19,003 --> 00:43:19,799
我？
With me?

529
00:43:20,605 --> 00:43:25,201
車感覺沉重，怎麼搞的？
全世界都在你肩上了
Yeah. Car feels heavy.
You know why?
You got the fuckin'
weight of the world
on your shoulders.

530
00:43:30,281 --> 00:43:32,215
學校裡出了點事
I got a little problem
at school, that's all.

531
00:43:32,617 --> 00:43:33,811
講吧
Spit it out!

532
00:43:34,018 --> 00:43:37,419
不是大事
我們去橡樹廳？
It's not a big deal,
all right?
Where we going,
the Oak Room
or somethin'?

533
00:43:37,488 --> 00:43:42,221
你說是「重要的事」
你和院長女兒上床了？
If it's not a big deal,
why did you say
real important stuff?
What are you doin',
banging the dean's daughter?
Hah!

534
00:43:46,164 --> 00:43:47,825
不是，惹了點麻煩而已
I'm just in
a little trouble.

535
00:43:47,899 --> 00:43:48,957
哪一類的？
What kind of trouble?

536
00:43:49,968 --> 00:43:51,629
我看到有些傢伙做的些事
I saw some guys
doing something.

537
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:57,904
要不要說，不然有得賠
To tell or not to tell,
or it's your ass.
Hmm?

538
00:44:02,046 --> 00:44:05,906
你怎麼知道？
我是男巫
細說從頭
How'd you know that?
I'm a wizard.
Give me the details,
come on.

539
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:18,254
有個叫哈瑞的，很有錢
他當頭兒
There's this guy
at school named Harry.
He's this
real rich kid,
and he like,
runs the show.

540
00:44:18,796 --> 00:44:19,785
別人呢？
Who else?

541
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,932
另一個叫喬治
什麼也沒做
There's another guy, George,
but George didn't do anything.

542
00:44:26,004 --> 00:44:28,598
我們看到哈瑞那伙做的事
George and I saw
Harry and his buddies
doin' somethin'.

543
00:44:29,874 --> 00:44:31,933
現在博德的人…
Now, the folks at Baird,

544
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,070
知道你和喬治能抓出元兇
they know you and George
can identify
the guilty parties?

545
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:41,941
他們以為我們會
喬治是你的朋友
Yeah, they think we can.
George is
a friend of yours.

546
00:44:43,621 --> 00:44:44,883
不是，不過他人不壞
He's not a friend,
but he's all right.

547
00:44:45,289 --> 00:44:46,085
你相信他？
You trust him?

548
00:44:47,558 --> 00:44:48,547
大概吧
Yeah, I guess so.

549
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,291
他也拿獎學金？
He's on
scholarship, too?

550
00:44:52,497 --> 00:44:53,486
沒有，有關係嗎？
No, why?

551
00:44:54,098 --> 00:44:56,965
我們有喬治、哈瑞和麻煩
We got George,
we got Harry,
we got trouble.

552
00:44:57,368 --> 00:45:00,030
他們有錢，你沒錢
你想有錢
They're rich, you're poor.
You wanna get rich.

553
00:45:00,104 --> 00:45:03,369
你想畢業後像他們一樣有錢
You wanna graduate Baird,
become a rich
big shot like them.

554
00:45:03,474 --> 00:45:06,534
對不對？
不，不完全是
Am I right?
No.
It's not that
way at all.

555
00:45:07,712 --> 00:45:08,838
好吧，查理
Okay, Charlie!

556
00:45:10,915 --> 00:45:13,179
到了，橡樹廳
Here we are, gentlemen,
the Oak Room.

557
00:45:13,851 --> 00:45:16,365
橡樹廳！
The Oak Room!

558
00:45:16,365 --> 00:45:19,960
菜單和雙份傑克丹尼爾加冰
Bring us a menu and
double Jack Daniels
on the rocks.
Charlie, sit down here.

559
00:45:20,702 --> 00:45:23,432
也許您穿上這件會更舒服些
你很帥
Perhaps you'll feel more
comfortable in this, sir.
You look great!
Thank you.

560
00:45:39,388 --> 00:45:42,448
這就是橡樹廳
Here we are, Charlie,
the Oak Room.

561
00:45:43,459 --> 00:45:45,723
現在念菜單吧
Now, read me
the bill of fare.

562
00:45:46,795 --> 00:45:47,454
好
Let's see.

563
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:51,397
橡樹廳漢堡加薯條
要24塊錢
You got the Oak Room
burger and fries for $24.

564
00:45:51,533 --> 00:45:54,730
酒呢？上菜慢的像泥巴
Where's the booze?
Flowin' like
mud around here.

565
00:45:55,003 --> 00:45:56,470
24塊的漢堡？
A $24 hamburger?

566
00:45:58,006 --> 00:45:59,064
怎麼搞的？
What's the story?

567
00:45:59,408 --> 00:46:00,340
什麼？
What story?

568
00:46:02,411 --> 00:46:04,402
你不是個
有錢的守財奴？
Are you a rich
miser or something?
Hah!

569
00:46:06,014 --> 00:46:08,141
不是，只是個普通瞎子罷了
No, I'm just
your average blind man.

570
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:09,744
「普通瞎子」
Your average
blind man.

571
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,415
你怎麼付這些錢呢？
How do you plan on paying
for all this stuff?

572
00:46:14,623 --> 00:46:17,615
用乾乾淨淨的美鈔
Crisp, clean dollars.
American.

573
00:46:18,093 --> 00:46:19,958
我存的傷殘退休俸
I saved up my
disability checks.

574
00:46:20,362 --> 00:46:26,959
你存了多少？
我們坐頭等艙還住華爾道夫
吃24塊錢的漢堡
How much did you save?
I mean, we flew first class,
we're at the Waldorf-Astoria,
a $24 hamburger restaurant.

575
00:46:27,035 --> 00:46:28,764
計劃的一部份
All part of
a plan, Charlie.

576
00:46:29,171 --> 00:46:30,502
要不要告訴我？
You want to let
me in on it?

577
00:46:30,706 --> 00:46:33,174
為什麼要？你又不關心
Why should I?
You're not interested.
You don't give a shit!

578
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:37,368
你就要坐末班飛機走了
You're leavin' on that
last shuttle
out of LaGuardia.
Hmm? Ooh!

579
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:43,975
只剩15分鐘
可能趕不上
You got 15 minutes, son.
I don't think
you're gonna make it.

580
00:46:44,987 --> 00:46:49,253
除非橡樹廳陽台上
有直升機
Unless the Oak Room
keeps some
complimentary
helicopter on the roof.

581
00:46:49,725 --> 00:46:52,057
不，不，先生
No, sir. No!

582
00:46:52,661 --> 00:46:54,128
你得待到明天
You're here till tomorrow.

583
00:46:55,931 --> 00:47:00,061
你說最後班機十點起飛
You said the last shuttle
leaves at 2200 hours.
That's 10:00, right?

584
00:47:01,136 --> 00:47:02,330
我是這麼聽說的
Last I heard, yeah.

585
00:47:03,605 --> 00:47:04,799
現在只有八點半
It's only ·:30.

586
00:47:05,607 --> 00:47:07,336
騙你的，飛機九點起飛
I lied. Leaves at 0:00.

587
00:47:08,343 --> 00:47:09,674
九點起飛？
It leaves at 0:00?

588
00:47:09,878 --> 00:47:16,548
別緊張
事實是，查理…
Calm down. Calm down.
Ahh! The truth is,
Charlie,

589
00:47:18,954 --> 00:47:22,754
我需要一隻導盲犬
幫我執行計劃
I need a guide dog
to help me execute my plan.

590
00:47:22,824 --> 00:47:23,483
什麼計劃？
What plan?

591
00:47:25,694 --> 00:47:27,025
你有權利知道
You have a right to know.

592
00:47:29,164 --> 00:47:34,227
不全是計劃
比較像旅行
It's not really a plan,
Charlie. It's sort of a...
More like a tour,

593
00:47:35,037 --> 00:47:37,164
小小的快樂之旅
a little tour
of pleasures.

594
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:41,908
一流的飯店，美食…
Stay in a first-class hotel,
eat an agreeable meal,

595
00:47:42,711 --> 00:47:44,235
飲一杯好酒
drink a nice
glass of wine,

596
00:47:46,448 --> 00:47:49,440
看我大哥…親情最偉大
see my big brother.
Nothing like family,
you know.

597
00:47:50,919 --> 00:47:54,787
然後和一個妙女郎做愛
And then, make love
to a terrific woman.

598
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:58,114
再然後
After that...
Yeah?

599
00:48:08,203 --> 00:48:12,401
我要躺在華爾道夫的
豪華大床
I'm gonna lie down on
my big, beautiful bed
at the Waldorf

600
00:48:12,941 --> 00:48:14,465
把我的腦袋射爛
and blow my brains out.

601
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,669
能向您建議特餐嗎？
May I tell you
our specials?

602
00:48:20,349 --> 00:48:21,543
可以
You may, sir.

603
00:48:22,417 --> 00:48:26,418
今日特餐有嫩烤碧玉絲…
和胡椒子
Tonight we have
charred venison with
buckwheat spaetzle
and green peppercorn.

604
00:48:26,888 --> 00:48:30,415
焗茄子
Grilled veal paillards,
tomato tapenade,
and roasted eggplants.

605
00:48:30,492 --> 00:48:32,153
我在流口水呢
Get me a napkin.
My mouth's watering.

606
00:48:32,494 --> 00:48:36,692
如果您要奶酥派
現在就要點
If you would like our
cr·me souffl· for dessert,
it would be a good
idea to order now.

607
00:48:37,032 --> 00:48:40,559
先點奶酥，其他的想一想
Yes, on the souffl·.
Give us a half a minute
on the rest.

608
00:48:41,169 --> 00:48:41,965
很好，先生
Very good, sir.

609
00:48:46,908 --> 00:48:48,375
我想吃烤碧綠絲
I'm leaning
towards the spaetzle.

610
00:48:48,844 --> 00:48:51,645
史中校…
桌上有小麵包嗎？
Colonel Slade...
Charlie, rolls on the table?

611
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,978
給我，你一定要嘗嘗
Give 'em to me.
You should
try these rolls, Charlie.

612
00:48:55,584 --> 00:49:02,186
我在華楚卡堡時做夢都夢到
科羅拉多以西的麵包就不行了
I used to dream about them
when I was at Fort Huachuca.
Colonel Slade...
Bread's no good
west of the Colorado.

613
00:49:02,257 --> 00:49:03,588
水太鹹
Water's too alkaline.

614
00:49:03,992 --> 00:49:05,391
史中校，剛才您說…
Colonel Slade,
did you say...

615
00:49:07,262 --> 00:49:08,456
我沒聽錯吧？
Did I hear you right?

616
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,128
你說你要自殺？
You said you're gonna
kill yourself?

617
00:49:12,934 --> 00:49:16,131
不對
我說我要把腦袋打爛
No.
I said I was gonna
blow my brains out.

618
00:49:17,606 --> 00:49:20,803
試試小麵包
我幫你塗奶油
Try one of these
rolls, Charlie.
I buttered it for you.

619
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:23,404
我不要吃
I don't want a roll,
all right?

620
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:25,408
那就吃點紅蘿蔔
Okay. Have a radish!
Hah!

621
00:49:29,017 --> 00:49:33,350
哈囉
再來一杯雙份的傑克丹尼爾
Hello! Bring me
a double Jack Daniels
on the rocks.

622
00:49:33,422 --> 00:49:34,753
立刻就來，先生
Yes, sir.
Right away.

623
00:49:38,627 --> 00:49:40,959
拜託，別來那套
Please, don't do that.

624
00:49:42,431 --> 00:49:43,625
不要
Don't do that.
Hmm.

625
00:49:54,976 --> 00:49:56,375
真是好地方！
What a marvelous place.
Okay.
Yeah.

626
00:50:09,191 --> 00:50:10,522
你睡這兒
Your billet is here.

627
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:14,590
床具在櫃裡
You'll find bedding
in the closet on the shelf.

628
00:50:15,731 --> 00:50:19,667
早晨要還原成起居間
In the morning,
the area will be
returned to
sitting-room mode

629
00:50:19,935 --> 00:50:22,335
不能睡過七點
no later than
0700 hours.

630
00:50:26,274 --> 00:50:27,263
你做什麼？
What was that?

631
00:50:30,345 --> 00:50:31,209
沒什麼
Nothing.

632
00:50:32,748 --> 00:50:35,683
下次，快動作
Next time
snap it out!

633
00:50:37,953 --> 00:50:40,945
大姆指頂掌心
食指要對準
成一齊線，頂住眉線
放下！
Thumb to palm, index finger
through little digit,
smartly aligned,
sharp to the hairline,
down!

634
00:50:50,766 --> 00:50:55,100
比你優秀的好多人
都敬過禮
Too many men,
far better than you,
have executed
that courtesy.

635
00:50:55,904 --> 00:50:59,237
你要是聰明的話
就別再做
And if you're smart,
you won't try it again.

636
00:51:02,978 --> 00:51:07,438
這老蝙蝠的雷達
可不是蓋的
This bat has
got sharper radar
than the Nautilus.

637
00:51:08,116 --> 00:51:09,583
少跟我玩花招，查理
Don't fuck with me,
Charlie.

638
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:23,395
好好睡一覺，孩子
See you get
a good night's
sleep, son.

639
00:51:36,571 --> 00:51:38,038
「今天多美好」
It's a lovely day today

640
00:51:39,173 --> 00:51:41,437
「不論做什麼」
So, whatever you gotta do

641
00:51:42,176 --> 00:51:45,043
「都是好日子，沒錯！」
You got a lovely day
to do it in, that's true

642
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:53,050
早安，查理
Good morning, Charlie.
Good morning.

643
00:51:58,326 --> 00:51:59,657
這是蘇菲亞
This is Sofia, Charlie.

644
00:52:00,128 --> 00:52:05,395
帶針線的魔術師
她在替我做衣服
She's a magician
with a needle.
Sofia's workin' me up
a little Glen Plaid number,

645
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,932
我請她也替你做一件
and I've asked her if
she'd put something
together for you.

646
00:52:08,736 --> 00:52:11,068
我不需要衣服，中校
I don't need
any clothes, Colonel.

647
00:52:11,139 --> 00:52:14,074
上流大都會任務的必備品
Standard issue
for an upscale
urban assignment.

648
00:52:14,609 --> 00:52:18,875
如果你不喜歡
任務完了就丟
You don't like the clothes,
Charlie,
on completion of duty,
you can give 'em away.

649
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,808
推車上有咖啡和小餅乾
Juice, coffee,
and other assorted goodies
on the trolley over there.

650
00:52:22,884 --> 00:52:25,216
快起來打點一下
Get yourself up,
get yourself together.

651
00:52:26,287 --> 00:52:28,881
「這是唱歌的好日子」
It's a great day
for singin' a song

652
00:52:28,956 --> 00:52:32,084
「也是前進的好日子」
And it's a great day
for movin' along

653
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,428
「從早到晚都是好時光」
And it's a great day
from morning to night

654
00:52:35,496 --> 00:52:37,020
「這是好日子」
And it's a great day

655
00:52:39,033 --> 00:52:40,898
「適合許心願」
For everybody's plight

656
00:52:47,442 --> 00:52:48,841
今天覺得怎樣？
How are you feeling
today, Colonel?

657
00:52:49,177 --> 00:52:51,839
棒，棒極了
Super!
Superior!

658
00:52:52,246 --> 00:52:53,907
沒必要的
Superfluous!

659
00:52:55,249 --> 00:52:59,583
蘇菲感恩節上班
她半工半讀
Young Sofie here
is working Thanksgiving
because she's trying to
put herself through college.

660
00:53:00,121 --> 00:53:02,783
我告訴她你也在上學
I told her, "My young friend
Charlie's headed for college."

661
00:53:03,324 --> 00:53:04,518
抱歉
Excuse me.

662
00:53:05,059 --> 00:53:05,787
你去哪？
Where you goin'?

663
00:53:05,993 --> 00:53:07,392
打電話
I need to use
the phone.

664
00:53:08,062 --> 00:53:09,529
這兒有電話
What's wrong with
the phones in here?

665
00:53:10,731 --> 00:53:12,130
我怕打擾你
I don't want
to disturb you.

666
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,061
你不會，在這兒打
You're not disturbing me.
Make your call.

667
00:53:15,603 --> 00:53:16,535
我需要隱私
I'd kind of like
to be private.

668
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,797
不准進我房間
Stay out of my room!

669
00:53:19,807 --> 00:53:21,536
這兒夠隱私啦
This is as private
as you're gonna get.
But if
you've got somethin'
that must be done
And it can only
be done by one

670
00:53:35,089 --> 00:53:40,152
可不可能讓你也換上西裝？
Sofia,
what are the chances
of suitin' you
up sometime?

671
00:53:41,829 --> 00:53:44,354
「甘蔗叢賓館」
請接喬治威利斯
Sugarbush Lodge.
George Willis, please.
Hello.

672
00:53:48,903 --> 00:53:54,031
喬治，我是查理
明年你一定要和我們一起來
George! Hey, it's Charlie.
Hey, Chas.
Next year you gotta
come up with us.

673
00:53:54,775 --> 00:53:57,243
白粉灑在兔女郎身上
White powder on
a base of snow bunnies.

674
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:01,314
你聽到了嗎？
Chas, are you there?

675
00:54:02,049 --> 00:54:05,985
你叫我打給你，問你計劃
Yeah, I'm here.
You told me to call
you for the moves.
All right.

676
00:54:07,522 --> 00:54:09,581
目前，計劃是按兵不動
保持現狀，先擱在一旁
For now, the move's
no move, status quo.
Everything's
the way we left it.

677
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:13,986
怎麼擱？
How did we leave it?

678
00:54:15,062 --> 00:54:17,860
沒聽到也沒看到
See no evil,
hear no eviI.

679
00:54:19,267 --> 00:54:20,598
懂我意思吧？
You know
what I mean, Chas?

680
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:25,202
沒聽到也沒看到
Yeah. See no evil,
hear no evil.

681
00:54:27,942 --> 00:54:29,603
好，輕輕鬆鬆
Okay, then,
walk like you talk.
All right, bye.

682
00:54:33,281 --> 00:54:34,213
喬治威利斯？
George Willis, huh?
Yeah.

683
00:54:38,085 --> 00:54:42,954
喬治威利斯
他爹可能是一世
George Willis.
That makes his
father probably
George Willis, Senior.

684
00:54:43,891 --> 00:54:45,756
查理，我問你…
Charlie, I ask you,

685
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,758
你猜老喬治會怎麼反應？
小喬治所說的
「沒看沒聽到」
what do you think
big George is gonna feel
about little George
seeing no evil,
hearing no evil?

686
00:54:55,570 --> 00:55:00,633
我們說好不告訴爸媽的
是我們的秘密
Well, we're not gonna
tell our parents.
We're just gonna keep it
between ourselves.

687
00:55:01,442 --> 00:55:15,177
喬治不告訴他爸？
真夠義氣
我喜歡你把我弄痛
告訴我，查理…
Oh, George isn't gonna tell
his father about this thing!
Damn decent of him.
Scusi, Colonnello.
Prego.
I love it
when you hurt me.
Tell me now,
Charlie.

688
00:55:15,323 --> 00:55:19,259
喬治威利斯的老爸
是幹嘛的？
This George Willis, Jr.,
what's his father do?

689
00:55:20,528 --> 00:55:21,392
不曉得
I don't really know.

690
00:55:21,996 --> 00:55:22,985
我來告訴你
Well, I'm gonna tell you.

691
00:55:24,131 --> 00:55:28,864
當他不忙著當保險公司大經理
When George Willis, Senior,
isn't busy as
a million-dollar man
for Aetna Casualty...

692
00:55:28,936 --> 00:55:32,269
或通用汽車駐英國總監的時候
Or is it
New England distributor
for the Chrysler
Corporation?

693
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:36,401
他會關心兒子的生活起居
He concerns himself
with his young son,
George Willis, Jr.

694
00:55:37,878 --> 00:55:39,812
喬治不會告訴他爸爸
George isn't going
to say anything
to his father.
Oh, Charlie.

695
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:44,477
老喬治會扭緊小喬治的發條
Big George is gonna
wind up little George,

696
00:55:44,552 --> 00:55:47,419
後者就會知無不言
and little George
is gonna sing
like a canary.

697
00:55:47,688 --> 00:55:50,213
你要聰明的話
你就先發制人
And if you're hip, kid,
you're gonna hop to, too.

698
00:55:50,758 --> 00:55:52,419
你都看透了嘛
You've got this
all figured out,
don't you?

699
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,896
不需要拿獎學金就能看透
It don't take no
Young American merit
scholarship to
figure this one out.

700
00:55:56,964 --> 00:56:00,764
你有你的人生，你念博德
Charlie,
you had a little life,
so you decided
to go to the
Baird school

701
00:56:00,835 --> 00:56:03,030
因為你想有前途
to put yourself
in the market
for a big one.

702
00:56:04,105 --> 00:56:08,906
要想不被淘汰
你就得說出來
Now, in order to stay
in the running,
you're gonna have
to tell these people
what they want to know.

703
00:56:10,444 --> 00:56:13,174
真的嗎？
好了嗎，蘇菲亞？
You think so?
Are we finished, Sofia?
Yes.
Grazie. Grazie.
Andate.

704
00:56:18,052 --> 00:56:22,386
你要是現在不說
Charlie,
if you don't sing now,

705
00:56:23,658 --> 00:56:25,057
就會落得…
在奧勒岡看一輩子的便利店
you're gonna end up,
not only shelving biscuits
in some convenience store
in the Oregon 'burbs,

706
00:56:29,997 --> 00:56:34,195
而且在你翹辮子前聽到的話…
是你對客人說的「多謝光臨」
but probably the last
word you'll ever hear
yourself say
just before you croak,
gonna be,
"Have a nice day
and come back soon."

707
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:44,607
快量查理的尺寸
我們要赴約
Sofia!
Measure up
Charlie, here, pronto.
We got a date
for Thanksgiving.

708
00:56:45,613 --> 00:56:46,545
我們要去赴約？
We got a date?

709
00:56:47,014 --> 00:56:51,678
我大哥家，白原鎮
紐約州
My brother's place.
W.R. Slade,
White Plains, New York.

710
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:55,152
我不能跟你去你大哥家
Colonel, I can't go with you
to your brother's place.

711
00:56:55,222 --> 00:56:58,089
我要趕回學校去
I mean, I should be
getting back to school.

712
00:57:01,562 --> 00:57:04,156
你總得過感恩節吧？
Well, you gotta have
Thanksgiving somewhere.

713
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:06,361
吃點，玩點
I mean, eats and treats.

714
00:57:07,234 --> 00:57:08,701
我又正好缺個伴
I can use
the company, Charlie.
All right.

715
00:57:14,108 --> 00:57:15,302
他知道我要來嗎？
Does he know
I'm comin'?

716
00:57:15,576 --> 00:57:20,377
他不知道我要來
我進門時你注意看他臉
He doesn't know
I'm comin'.
But wait till you see
the look on his face
when I walk
through the door.

717
00:57:20,514 --> 00:57:21,845
他愛我
Oh, he loves me!

718
00:57:24,452 --> 00:57:28,249
噢，查理…
至於你的麻煩
Oh, Charlie,
about your
little problem,

719
00:57:28,389 --> 00:57:33,383
世上有兩種人
勇於負責的人
there are two kinds
of people in this world:
Those who stand up
and face the music,

720
00:57:33,461 --> 00:57:36,589
和去找靠山的人
有靠山比較好
and those who
run for cover.
Cover's better.

721
00:57:37,064 --> 00:57:38,725
好啦，蘇菲亞，給他穿上
Okay, Sofia, suit him up!

722
00:57:39,467 --> 00:57:40,866
讓他帥點！
Make him pretty.

723
00:57:57,066 --> 00:57:58,055
小心
Careful.

724
00:58:00,069 --> 00:58:01,400
要按門鈴嗎？
好
Should I ring it?
Yeah.

725
00:58:10,747 --> 00:58:11,577
什麼事？
什麼事？你是誰？
Yes?
Yes!
Who is this?

726
00:58:15,084 --> 00:58:16,142
藍迪
It's Randy.

727
00:58:16,686 --> 00:58:18,483
藍迪？你是我新親戚？
Randy? You new?

728
00:58:19,689 --> 00:58:20,747
我是你外甥
我來啦
你姐姐可是想死我了
I'm your nephew.
Hah! Here I am!
Your sister's been
hoarding me
long enough.

729
00:58:25,428 --> 00:58:27,419
散財的時候到啦！
Thought it's time
to spread the
riches around.

730
00:58:28,965 --> 00:58:30,626
法蘭克叔叔
葛蘿莉亞
Uncle Frank.
Gloria!

731
00:58:31,201 --> 00:58:37,362
吉兒
來嘛，說聲哈囉…
我可是大老遠從紐約來的
Gail.
Of course.
Say hello to the potluck
party from New York City.

732
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,432
你的法蘭克叔叔和查理西門
Good old Uncle
Frank and this here
with him is Charlie Simms,

733
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:43,308
博德學院足球隊中衛
star halfback of the
Baird football team.

734
00:58:43,413 --> 00:58:47,543
他們打敗艾斯特隊和國頓
連阿納斯中學都不是對手
They not only beat
Exeter and Groton,
but Aquinas High School, too.

735
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:49,979
你們倒霉的爹在哪？
Where's your
miserable father?

736
00:58:50,053 --> 00:58:55,850
不，等等，嚇他一跳
叫他的肥心臟跳一下！
威利！
Wait! No, no.
Let's surprise him.
Give that fat
heart of his
an attack. Willie!

737
00:58:58,027 --> 00:58:59,016
威利！
Ho, Willie!

738
00:59:12,642 --> 00:59:13,301
哈囉！法蘭克
Hello, Frank.

739
00:59:14,744 --> 00:59:17,474
你好？這是我助理
How you doin'?
Okay.
Here's my hand.

740
00:59:20,083 --> 00:59:22,551
查理，見過史雷德先生
Charlie, meet
W.R. Slade.
Nice to meet you, sir.

741
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:25,747
最典型的公事箱男士！
The original
bulging briefcase man.

742
00:59:26,689 --> 00:59:32,026
葛心，有梅子的味道！
是不是有烤火雞？
是的，法蘭克
Gretchen, I smell
those prunes!
We talkin'
turkey Marbella?
Yes, we are.

743
00:59:35,031 --> 00:59:38,967
咱們來聞聞，來嘛
我一向暗戀著你
Let's have a whiff.
Come on.
You know, I always
had a sneaker for you.
Come here.

744
00:59:43,072 --> 00:59:45,063
你跑那去了，蓋瑞？
Where are you, Garry?
I heard you cough.
Right here.

745
00:59:45,141 --> 00:59:46,403
你說你是誰來著？
Who are you again?

746
00:59:47,243 --> 00:59:51,771
我待在華爾道夫和…
您是他大哥嗎？
I'm here at
the Waldorf with...
Is it your brother?

747
00:59:51,981 --> 00:59:54,313
大哥的小寶貝，你好
W.R.'s final issue.
How ya doin', son?

748
00:59:54,517 --> 00:59:56,712
他是我弟弟，你又是誰？
Yeah, sure,
Frank's my brother.
Who the hell are you?

749
00:59:57,854 --> 00:59:59,446
我算他的看護吧
I'm takin' care of him
for the weekend.
Charlie.

750
01:00:03,159 --> 01:00:07,653
抱歉，酒呢？
這兒的步調真慢
Sorry.
Where's the booze?
Flowin' like mud here.

751
01:00:07,764 --> 01:00:11,427
老實說吧
中校情況不太好
To tell the truth,
the Colonel's not well,
I don't think.

752
01:00:12,101 --> 01:00:13,090
不太好？
Not well?

753
01:00:13,836 --> 01:00:15,497
我想他很寂寞
I think he's
a little lonely.

754
01:00:16,305 --> 01:00:18,102
那你帶他回你家去
Why didn't you
take him to your
family's for dinner?

755
01:00:18,441 --> 01:00:19,237
我聽到了
I heard that!

756
01:00:22,044 --> 01:00:25,980
別管我，查理
「老大哥經」
I heard that.
Pay no attention
to him, Charlie.
That's just big-brother talk.

757
01:00:26,582 --> 01:00:28,641
從我出生起他就管著我
He's been watching out
for me since day one.

758
01:00:29,385 --> 01:00:33,185
替我收的爛攤子
連他也記不清
Bailed me out of more trouble
than he'd like to remember.

759
01:00:34,457 --> 01:00:35,924
我來幫你放大衣
Here, let me
take your coat.

760
01:00:37,393 --> 01:00:40,191
本來要帶酒來的
竟然忘了
I meant to pick up
some vino on my way up,
but I blew it.

761
01:00:40,596 --> 01:00:45,260
聖誕節給你們寄好酒
先看看今天處得好不好吧
I'll send you the
Rothschild again
for Christmas,
only let's see how
Thanksgiving goes.

762
01:00:45,668 --> 01:00:48,398
我再加兩個位子
你的酒
I'll set two
more places.
Here's
your drink, Frank.

763
01:00:48,671 --> 01:00:52,129
謝謝
還在雪後糖廠工作？
Thank you, Randy.
Still with
Snow Queen Sugar?

764
01:00:53,276 --> 01:00:56,939
是雪焰
你怎麼老是搞錯？
Snow Flake.
Why do you always
get that wrong?

765
01:00:57,113 --> 01:01:00,310
反正對錯也不重要
你做什麼
Because it's not
important for me
to get it right.
What are you doing
there now?

766
01:01:01,684 --> 01:01:03,618
市場行銷副總裁
恭喜，雖然糖很糟糕
I'm vice president
for marketing.
Hoo-ah!
Congratulations!
Sugar is shit, though.

767
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:09,614
我告訴阿伯姆將軍…
改供蜂蜜，糖會要人命
I told General Abrams,
install honey in
the commissaries.
If K-50s didn't
blow your brains out,
sugar, sure as shit,
was gonna.

768
01:01:16,499 --> 01:01:17,761
我們何不都坐下？
Why don't we
all sit down?
Ooh.

769
01:01:18,768 --> 01:01:25,433
誘人的「蜜祖琪」
小心
老婆靜不下來的時候
她就如狼似虎了
Mitsouki. Rhymes
with nookie.
Be careful.
When the wife
gets restless,
the wife gets racy.

770
01:01:25,508 --> 01:01:26,634
吃飯吧
Well, let's
go and eat,
shall we?

771
01:01:27,009 --> 01:01:27,998
跟我來
By all means.
Thank you, Charlie.

772
01:01:31,714 --> 01:01:35,912
你想坐哪，法蘭克？
還是主位？
Where you
wanna sit, Frank?
At the head again?

773
01:01:35,985 --> 01:01:39,648
麻將桌也成
這兒很好
Any old card table
will do. This is fine.

774
01:01:41,724 --> 01:01:43,487
我講到哪了？
Where was I?

775
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:46,960
我早上四點醒來
不知道身邊是誰
So, I wake up.
It's 4:00 in the morning.
I don't know who I'm with

776
01:01:47,029 --> 01:01:48,826
也不知道人在哪
or why I'm there,
or where I am.

777
01:01:49,398 --> 01:01:52,333
這朵亞洲小野花…
What am I gonna do?
I got this Asian flower

778
01:01:52,668 --> 01:01:56,671
躺在一邊
巧笑倩兮
on one hand,
all giggly and dewy-like,

779
01:01:57,006 --> 01:02:00,806
力大如牛的海軍護士
躺在另一邊
and this hard-boiled
Navy nurse outta Omaha,
on the other.

780
01:02:00,877 --> 01:02:04,938
三個成人一張床
一件衣裳也沒穿
We're three across
the bed, not a stitch
of clothes on.

781
01:02:05,348 --> 01:02:06,679
我忽然有了點子！
It comes to me.

782
01:02:07,817 --> 01:02:12,345
東西匯合，性橋一座！
Let east meet west.
We'll build a
golden bridge.

783
01:02:14,223 --> 01:02:16,885
簡直像個工程大隊！
I felt like I'd just joined
the corps of engineers!

784
01:02:23,266 --> 01:02:24,392
你們還在聽？
We all still here?

785
01:02:25,902 --> 01:02:27,369
好美的故事
It's a
beautiful story.

786
01:02:30,306 --> 01:02:34,572
你語不驚人死不休是吧？
Do you always enjoy
shocking people,
Uncle Frank?
Honey...

787
01:02:35,244 --> 01:02:37,109
沒想到你這麼容易被驚
I didn't know
you were so
easily shocked, Randy.

788
01:02:37,847 --> 01:02:39,712
佩服你的敏感
I admire your
sensibilities,
I'm touched.

789
01:02:39,982 --> 01:02:45,545
爸，記得你叫法蘭克
去狗屋的事？
Dad, remember the time
you persuaded Frank
to go to the kennel?

790
01:02:45,621 --> 01:02:46,280
怎麼樣？
What about it?

791
01:02:46,389 --> 01:02:48,414
他差點把人家生意毀了
He almost put
the seeing eye dog business
outta business.

792
01:02:48,558 --> 01:02:49,650
夠了
Cool it, Randy.

793
01:02:50,059 --> 01:02:51,117
都過去了
It's over and done with.

794
01:02:52,461 --> 01:02:53,928
可不是嘛，蓋瑞
Indeed it is, Garry.

795
01:02:54,263 --> 01:02:56,128
都過去了，晚餐也完了
Indeed it is.
So is dinner.

796
01:02:56,532 --> 01:02:59,467
查理，幾點了？
我們該走了
Charlie, what time
you have?
I think we better
be gettin' back.

797
01:02:59,735 --> 01:03:02,932
有沒有想過換隻盲人錶？
You ever given
any thought to
a Braille watch, Frank?
Randy...

798
01:03:03,973 --> 01:03:07,568
史提夫汪達也戴
你不喜歡是吧？
Stevie Wonder wears one,
or do you rank on him, too?

799
01:03:07,643 --> 01:03:08,575
甜心，夠了
Honey, please.

800
01:03:08,811 --> 01:03:10,938
沒關係，葛蘿莉亞…
It's all right, Gloria.
I enjoy Randy's
observations.

801
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:14,880
我太太叫葛兒，法蘭克！
你聽到沒？是葛兒
My wife's name
is Gail, Frank.
Can you hear that?
Gail.

802
01:03:15,151 --> 01:03:17,483
對不起，葛兒
Excuse me.
Gail.

803
01:03:18,487 --> 01:03:20,887
葛兒一定是個漂亮女人
Gail strikes me as
a very beautiful woman,

804
01:03:21,424 --> 01:03:23,949
但是她的聲音裡透著緊張
but, you know,
there's a little
tension in her voice.

805
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,822
可能有一兩個原因
I don't know what it is.
It could be one
of two things,

806
01:03:27,029 --> 01:03:29,327
她緊張，或者不滿現狀
either Gail is nervous
or unsatisfied.

807
01:03:31,968 --> 01:03:33,230
你什麼意思？
What's your point,
Uncle Frank?

808
01:03:33,502 --> 01:03:34,491
你應該親她那裡
You ought to
go down on her.

809
01:03:35,705 --> 01:03:37,297
住口，法蘭克
Cut it out, Frank,
will ya?

810
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,240
你滿腦子放在糖生意上
卻忘了真正的蜜糖！
You've gotten
so wrapped up
in sugar,
you forgotten
the taste of
real honey!

811
01:03:41,744 --> 01:03:43,211
法蘭克，住口
Frank, for
God's sake!

812
01:03:43,312 --> 01:03:45,906
聽到沒？
她衣裳下有熊熊烈火
Hear that voice?
There's fire
under that dress.

813
01:03:46,048 --> 01:03:48,111
住口！
你給我出去！
Will you cut it out?
Just get the fuck
outta here.

814
01:03:48,184 --> 01:03:53,850
到花街去吧！
跟你同類在一起
Hoo-ah!
Get in your limousine.
Go down to the Bowery.
Get with the other fucking
drunks, where you belong!

815
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:55,049
等一等…
Wait a minute.

816
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:57,517
幹嘛
別認真
What?
Can you take it easy?

817
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,661
為什麼？你要我讓他
因為他是瞎子，「查仔」？
What for?
You want me to lay off him,
Chucky, 'cause he's blind?

818
01:04:02,765 --> 01:04:03,561
不是，但…
No, but...

819
01:04:03,633 --> 01:04:04,691
我朋友的名字是查理
My friend's name is Charles.

820
01:04:05,835 --> 01:04:07,325
別叫他查仔
He doesn't like to
be called Chucky.

821
01:04:07,803 --> 01:04:09,896
今天是一家人團圓
This is supposed to be
a family get-together.

822
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,035
我先警告你了
Just a warning.

823
01:04:11,674 --> 01:04:22,079
老天爺！
又來一個把白癡當英雄的笨蛋
還是過氣的！
Jesus Christ,
another sucker who thinks
this shit-heel's a war hero.
Hoo-ah!
Well, once, maybe.

824
01:04:23,019 --> 01:04:26,284
他一定跟你吹過他
當詹森幕僚
I suppose he told
you about his days on
Lyndon Johnson's staff?

825
01:04:26,355 --> 01:04:27,822
本來我要走，現在不了
I was gonna go.
Now I'm not leaving.

826
01:04:29,659 --> 01:04:31,991
法蘭克本來被內定升將軍
Frank was earmarked
for general.

827
01:04:32,294 --> 01:04:33,318
內定…好字眼
Earmarked, good word.

828
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:36,496
但是他朝每個人亂開炮
Frank likes to spit
in everybody's eye!

829
01:04:36,565 --> 01:04:37,554
夠了
Randy, that's enough.

830
01:04:37,733 --> 01:04:41,999
他們…
軍中術語是什麼來著
So they, what do they call it,
when they give you the
shaft in the military?

831
01:04:42,371 --> 01:04:43,030
跳過！
Passed over!

832
01:04:43,339 --> 01:04:46,536
法蘭克就被跳過了
Right, Frank was
passed over
for promotion.

833
01:04:47,443 --> 01:04:48,569
好幾次
Couple times.

834
01:04:53,115 --> 01:04:53,979
結果…
You wanna know
what happened then?

835
01:04:54,216 --> 01:04:55,205
閉嘴！
Will you shut
your mouth?

836
01:04:55,685 --> 01:04:56,743
他自己搞砸了
He blew himself up.

837
01:04:56,986 --> 01:04:58,180
住口！
Stop it, Randy.

838
01:04:58,621 --> 01:05:00,145
中校拿著手榴彈…
在布拉格堡還是什麼的鬼地方
Our Colonel here had
a grenade juggling act
at Fort Bragg, or wherever
it was they dumped him.

839
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:05,322
班寧堡
Fort Benning.

840
01:05:05,394 --> 01:05:08,329
他正在教白刃戰…
He was teaching
hand-to-hand combat
to second lieutenants...

841
01:05:08,397 --> 01:05:10,729
跟我講話時候要看著我
Randy, look at me when
you're talking to me,
now, son.

842
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:15,298
我是在看，法蘭克
他的夥伴是上尉…
I'm lookin', Frank.
His partner in the act
was some captain.

843
01:05:15,471 --> 01:05:18,031
文生史奎斯少校
管他是誰
Major Vincent Squires.
Whoever he was.

844
01:05:18,107 --> 01:05:23,609
他們先喝早餐酒
法蘭克喝的是伏特加
夥伴喝的是血腥瑪莉
Before going on, they'd
have a lo-cal breakfast,
a screwdriver for Frank,
bloody mary for his partner.

845
01:05:23,779 --> 01:05:25,542
文生又愛喝混酒
No, Vincent drank
Sea Breezes.

846
01:05:25,715 --> 01:05:31,149
班寧堡的法官說法蘭克喝的
至少是他夥伴的四倍
班寧堡的法官說法蘭克喝的
至少是他夥伴的四倍
The Judge Advocate
at Benning said
Colonel Slade had four
to his partner's one.

847
01:05:31,255 --> 01:05:33,746
他在課堂上騰雲駕霧
他開始拉出插銷
He's really
flying in class.
He gets all excited.
He starts pulling
the pins out.

848
01:05:39,296 --> 01:05:41,025
一枚手榴彈鬆了手
One grenade got
away from him.

849
01:05:41,832 --> 01:05:42,821
碰…！
Boom.

850
01:05:45,836 --> 01:05:47,303
鬆手的那枚…
The one that got away.

851
01:05:47,638 --> 01:05:50,630
法蘭克堅持沒拔插銷
The pin was in,
Frank claims.

852
01:05:52,176 --> 01:05:53,666
有什麼差別？
In or out, what
difference does it make?

853
01:05:53,844 --> 01:05:55,971
哪個笨蛋會去玩手榴彈？
What kind of
fucking lunatic
juggles grenades?

854
01:05:57,581 --> 01:05:58,570
文生倒沒事
Vinnie came out okay.

855
01:05:58,849 --> 01:06:00,976
法蘭克也只不過瞎了而已
想不想聽實話？
你猜是什麼？
All Frank lost
was his eyesight.
You wanna know
the truth?
Got a handle
on that, do you?

856
01:06:08,125 --> 01:06:09,456
他以前是個王八蛋
He was
an asshole before.
Hoo-ah!

857
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:25,608
現在是個瞎了眼的王八蛋
上帝很好玩
Now all he is,
is a blind asshole.
Hoo-ah.
Hey, God's a funny guy.

858
01:06:27,745 --> 01:06:29,804
挺有幽默感的
God doth have
a sense of humor.

859
01:06:32,349 --> 01:06:36,012
也許上帝覺得
有人不配去看
Maybe God thinks
some people don't
deserve to see.
Hoo-ah.

860
01:06:43,026 --> 01:06:44,687
懂了吧？「查仔」
You get
the point, Chucky?

861
01:06:50,234 --> 01:06:51,496
他叫查理
His name is Charles.

862
01:06:52,903 --> 01:06:54,837
會不會念？查理
You can say that,
can't you? Charles.

863
01:06:55,105 --> 01:06:56,163
知道這是什麼吧？
以前我教那些小鬼的鎖喉扣
Know what this is, Randy?
It's a Ranger choke hold.
From teaching
those lieutenants.
Colonel, let go.

864
01:06:59,643 --> 01:07:02,168
再使點力
你的氣管就破了
Little pressure,
I bust your windpipe.

865
01:07:02,513 --> 01:07:04,174
我不介意的
I don't care
what he said to me.
After me.

866
01:07:04,248 --> 01:07:06,648
查理
中校，我們走吧
Charles.
Just let go, please!

867
01:07:26,937 --> 01:07:27,926
葛心…
Gretchen?

868
01:07:29,673 --> 01:07:31,197
你菜燒得比上次好
You outdid yourself.

869
01:07:33,744 --> 01:07:38,010
你可把我迷住了
明年我們吃火雞大餐
If you twist my
arm hard enough,
we're talking
turkey Marbella
next year.

870
01:07:38,949 --> 01:07:40,007
也許吧？
Who knows?
Frank?

871
01:07:49,293 --> 01:07:50,351
再會，威利
Goodbye, Willie.

872
01:07:55,699 --> 01:07:57,030
我是爛人
I'm no fucking good.

873
01:07:59,837 --> 01:08:01,168
一直都是
And I never have been.

874
01:08:07,845 --> 01:08:10,109
走吧，查理，拿大衣
小心
Come on, Charlie,
get the coats.
Colonel.
Watch your step.
Hold it.

875
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:40,732
回紐約，兄弟！
走吧
Nueva York,
compadre. Vamos!

876
01:09:25,455 --> 01:09:26,581
有沒戴錶？
You got a watch?

877
01:09:30,661 --> 01:09:32,390
七點廿分
It's 7:20.

878
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:35,992
我問你有沒有戴錶
不是幾點
I didn't ask you the time.
I asked if you had a watch.

879
01:09:37,668 --> 01:09:38,657
在另一個房間
Yeah, in the other room.

880
01:09:39,336 --> 01:09:40,325
去拿
Get it.

881
01:09:44,608 --> 01:09:46,599
你床旁邊有鐘
Colonel, there's a clock
right next to your bed.

882
01:09:48,946 --> 01:09:50,607
有沒有秒針？
Does it have
a second hand?

883
01:09:57,254 --> 01:09:59,210
有
替我計時
Yeah.
Time me!

884
01:10:26,917 --> 01:10:27,906
多久？
How long?

885
01:10:31,922 --> 01:10:33,321
差不多三十秒
About 30 seconds.

886
01:10:34,124 --> 01:10:35,182
我老了
I'm rusty.

887
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:38,252
你哪來的槍？
Where did you get
a gun, Colonel?

888
01:10:38,328 --> 01:10:40,518
「零件」或「武器」
別叫它做槍
Piece or weapon,
Charlie,
never gun.

889
01:10:44,001 --> 01:10:45,525
你從哪來的這些零件？
Where did you
get the piece?

890
01:10:46,603 --> 01:10:51,199
我是美國陸軍軍官
它是我的隨身配備
I'm an officer
in the US Army.
This is my sidearm.

891
01:10:52,075 --> 01:10:55,408
可是你已經退役了
我是退役了，又怎樣
But you're not
an officer anymore.
So I'm retired,
so what?

892
01:10:56,146 --> 01:10:58,808
軍官永遠不離他的點45
An officer never
relinquishes his.45.

893
01:10:59,349 --> 01:11:02,750
最好把它給我
不然我打電話給羅絲太太
You better relinquish
it to me or I'm gonna
have to call Mrs. Rossi.

894
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:04,278
好主意
Good idea.

895
01:11:06,156 --> 01:11:07,145
不然我就回學校
Then I'm going
back to school.

896
01:11:08,025 --> 01:11:09,925
更好！窗外有藍天
旅途愉快
Even better.
Blue skies, green lights.
I hope you have
a wonderful trip.

897
01:11:12,295 --> 01:11:16,493
應該只花了廿五秒吧？
你量了沒有？
That felt like 25.
Gotta be able to
do a.45 in 25.
Did you time me?

898
01:11:16,566 --> 01:11:18,761
沒有，我要打給羅絲太太
I did not and
I'm calling Albany.

899
01:11:28,912 --> 01:11:29,901
那很愚蠢
That was stupid.

900
01:11:31,782 --> 01:11:32,771
是嗎？
Was it?

901
01:11:34,785 --> 01:11:36,116
你跟定我了
You're stuck with me,
Charlie.

902
01:11:37,721 --> 01:11:39,545
沒有，我要走了
沒有，我要走了
No, I'm not.
I'm outta here!

903
01:11:39,618 --> 01:11:41,142
回新罕布夏？
Where you going,
New Hampshire?

904
01:11:41,353 --> 01:11:43,344
怎麼回去？你沒錢
You got no money.
How you gonna do that?

905
01:11:48,026 --> 01:11:50,358
凱倫的號碼嘗起來像在艾伯尼
Karen's number
tastes like Albany.

906
01:11:53,432 --> 01:11:55,093
好吧，我走了
Fine.
I'm leaving.

907
01:11:55,167 --> 01:11:57,567
查理！
Charlie. Charlie!

908
01:12:10,449 --> 01:12:14,249
我只要你…
多陪我一天
All I want from you
is another day.

909
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:16,509
做什麼？
For what?

910
01:12:19,524 --> 01:12:22,186
戰場最後的巡禮…
One last tour
of the battlefield.

911
01:12:26,198 --> 01:12:28,325
紐約我很熟
I can get around
a city like New York,

912
01:12:29,735 --> 01:12:30,724
但是…
but I

913
01:12:31,670 --> 01:12:34,332
偶爾我需要有人指點方向
sometimes need a point
in the right direction.

914
01:12:37,809 --> 01:12:39,276
如何，查理？
What do you say,
Charles?

915
01:12:39,745 --> 01:12:42,737
陪朋友一天算得了什麼？
What's one day
between friends?

916
01:12:46,818 --> 01:12:51,949
如果我多留一天…
你能把武器交給我嗎？
All right. Say I stay
for another day.
Will you give me
your weapon?
Oh, Charlie,

917
01:12:54,226 --> 01:12:56,217
我是美國陸軍中校
I'm a lieutenant colonel,
United States Army.

918
01:12:56,295 --> 01:12:58,627
我不把槍交給任何人
I'm not giving
my fucking gun
to anyone.

919
01:12:58,964 --> 01:13:00,295
你要喝什麼？
Now, what are
you drinkin'?

920
01:13:01,366 --> 01:13:03,300
中校，這種行為是不對的
Colonel, this
is unacceptable.

921
01:13:03,902 --> 01:13:08,305
不對的？
少給我那套公子經！
Unacceptable?
What are you givin' me
that prep school crap for?
Unacceptable?

922
01:13:08,373 --> 01:13:11,706
他們怎麼把你弄得
這麼沒人性
What have they done,
taken the Oregon
out of the boy?

923
01:13:12,144 --> 01:13:13,907
答應你哈佛的獎學金是吧？
Put in Harvard
Business School?

924
01:13:15,447 --> 01:13:16,573
不然把子彈給我
Then give me
your bullets.

925
01:13:23,221 --> 01:13:25,883
你看穿我要自殺了？
You do see the sense of it,
Charlie, don't you?

926
01:13:29,394 --> 01:13:31,385
我已形同廢物
I can't chew
the leather anymore.

927
01:13:32,698 --> 01:13:37,897
為什麼要浪費糧食？
So, why should I share
the tribe's provisions?

928
01:13:39,738 --> 01:13:41,467
我是說，沒有人…
I mean, there's no one

929
01:13:42,341 --> 01:13:45,003
願意和我共渡良宵了
wants to tear a herring
with me anymore.

930
01:13:47,779 --> 01:13:48,837
子彈給我，中校
The bullets, Colonel.

931
01:13:49,481 --> 01:13:53,815
你聽來像「傲世軍魂」男主角
"The bullets, Colonel."
You sound like a guy in
Lives of a Bengal Lancer.

932
01:14:13,638 --> 01:14:15,299
你才不關心呢？
What do you
give a shit for?

933
01:14:17,175 --> 01:14:18,164
你指什麼？
About what?

934
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:19,699
什麼什麼？
About what?

935
01:14:20,645 --> 01:14:23,375
我是不是把自己打的
腦袋開花
About whether
I blow my brains
out or not.

936
01:14:29,521 --> 01:14:31,318
我有良心
Because I have
a conscience.

937
01:14:31,390 --> 01:14:32,516
良心
You have
a conscience.

938
01:14:34,192 --> 01:14:35,386
我竟然忘了
I forgot.

939
01:14:37,062 --> 01:14:38,723
查理的良心
The Charlie Conscience.

940
01:14:41,066 --> 01:14:43,398
要說？還是不說
Do we tell?
Do we not tell?

941
01:14:45,137 --> 01:14:48,004
要不要聽從有錢少爺們？
Do we follow
the rich boy's code
or not?

942
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:51,272
要不要讓這瞎眼王八蛋…
Do we let this
blind asshole

943
01:14:52,077 --> 01:14:53,942
去死？
die or not?
Yeah.

944
01:14:56,515 --> 01:14:58,506
良心，查理
Conscience, Charlie.

945
01:14:59,551 --> 01:15:00,882
你何時出生的？
When were
you born, son?

946
01:15:01,486 --> 01:15:03,351
圓桌武士時代？
Around the time
of the Round Table?

947
01:15:05,090 --> 01:15:06,421
你聽見我沒有？
Haven't you heard?

948
01:15:07,225 --> 01:15:10,217
良心已死
Conscience is dead.

949
01:15:11,163 --> 01:15:12,357
不，我沒聽說過
No, I haven't heard.

950
01:15:12,697 --> 01:15:16,565
那就他媽的擦乾淨你耳朵
Then take the fucking wax
outta your ears!

951
01:15:19,538 --> 01:15:20,300
長大！
Grow up!

952
01:15:31,983 --> 01:15:33,314
滾你媽的蛋，小傢伙
It's fuck your buddy.

953
01:15:35,187 --> 01:15:36,848
欺騙你太太
Cheat on your wife.

954
01:15:40,192 --> 01:15:42,660
母親節打電話問候你媽
Call your mother
on Mother's Day.
Charlie,

955
01:15:47,399 --> 01:15:48,798
都是狗屎
it's all shit.

956
01:16:00,612 --> 01:16:01,601
你去哪裡
Where you goin'?

957
01:16:03,215 --> 01:16:04,546
去尿尿
I got piss call.

958
01:16:06,618 --> 01:16:09,553
雖然我說要你多留一天…
I know I said I need ya
forjust one day

959
01:16:09,621 --> 01:16:11,953
我的尿可等不了那麼久
but even I can't
hold it that long.

960
01:16:14,559 --> 01:16:15,548
查理！
Oh, and Charlie,

961
01:16:17,762 --> 01:16:19,286
你忘了槍膛裡還有一粒
you forgot the one
in the chamber.

962
01:16:28,373 --> 01:16:29,362
好了，先生
There you go, sir.

963
01:16:30,575 --> 01:16:31,303
謝謝
Thank you.

964
01:16:34,846 --> 01:16:39,977
服役26年
從沒讓助理擦過鞋
Twenty-six years
in the service,
never let an aide
shine my shoes.

965
01:16:40,785 --> 01:16:43,117
26年後你會在哪裡？
Where you gonna be
in 26 years, Charlie?

966
01:16:44,189 --> 01:16:47,716
和你博德的老友
打高爾夫吧
Playing golf with
your friends from
the Baird School, I bet.

967
01:16:50,929 --> 01:16:52,590
我根本不喜歡他們
I don't even
like those guys.

968
01:16:53,331 --> 01:16:56,198
你當然不喜歡
他們是王八蛋
Of course you don't.
They're all assholes.

969
01:16:57,335 --> 01:16:59,326
能說出他們就好了
Be a pleasure to
squeal on 'em,
wouldn't it?

970
01:17:00,872 --> 01:17:02,533
我不是告密的小人
Yeah, well,
I'm not a squealer.

971
01:17:02,674 --> 01:17:03,800
「我不是告密的小人！」
"I'm not a squealer."

972
01:17:04,209 --> 01:17:05,938
這是什麼？冤獄啊？
What is this,
the Dreyfus case?

973
01:17:10,815 --> 01:17:12,544
哦，媽呀…
Ooh. Ooh, mama!
There you go.
Thank you.
Thank you.

974
01:17:18,823 --> 01:17:19,755
小心
Watch your step.

975
01:17:22,894 --> 01:17:25,556
我又有預感了，查理
I'm gettin' that heavy
feelin' again, Charlie.

976
01:17:29,501 --> 01:17:30,763
這事還沒完呢
There's more to this,
isn't there?

977
01:17:33,038 --> 01:17:34,027
不是嗎？
Isn't there?

978
01:17:37,842 --> 01:17:39,173
有人賄賂我
I was offered
a bribe.

979
01:17:40,178 --> 01:17:41,577
有點開竅了
Now we're cookin'.

980
01:17:43,181 --> 01:17:45,649
校長垂斯克先生…
Mr. Trask,
the headmaster,

981
01:17:47,986 --> 01:17:49,647
答應讓我進哈佛
he promised to get
me into Harvard.

982
01:17:49,821 --> 01:17:50,947
只要你告密
If you squeal.
Yeah.

983
01:17:53,191 --> 01:17:54,249
真是悲劇
What a dilemma.

984
01:17:54,993 --> 01:17:58,793
查理西門
該不該搭便車進哈佛
Should Charlie Simms
accept a free ride
into Harvard, or not?

985
01:18:01,066 --> 01:18:04,263
易地而處，喬治會怎麼辦？
What do you think your
friend George would do
if he were in your shoes?

986
01:18:05,003 --> 01:18:07,267
他一定會的
怎麼說？
垂斯克先生
沒說要送他進哈佛
He is,
practically.
How?
It's just that Mr. Trask
hasn't promised to get
him into Harvard.

987
01:18:12,077 --> 01:18:16,411
他不必要
喬治的爹會想辦法
Mr. Trask
doesn't have to.
George's father's
gonna take care
of that.

988
01:18:18,583 --> 01:18:22,451
點頭吧，查理
進哈佛去
Do the deal,
Charlie. Take it!
Go to Harvard.

989
01:18:23,755 --> 01:18:24,949
我不能這麼做
I can't do that.

990
01:18:25,256 --> 01:18:26,245
為什麼不能？
Why not?

991
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:31,490
有些事你就是不能做
There are just
some things
you can't do.

992
01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:33,561
解釋給我聽
Explain 'em to me.

993
01:18:35,767 --> 01:18:36,961
大聲一點，拜託
Louder, please.

994
01:18:37,035 --> 01:18:38,366
我不能…
I can't...

995
01:18:40,438 --> 01:18:43,168
你在這世上可要吃苦頭了
You're gonna
have a tough time
in this world, Charlie.

996
01:18:45,043 --> 01:18:48,842
為了讓你放輕鬆
請你喝一杯
走吧
To ease the blow,
let me buy you
a drink. Come on.

997
01:18:50,115 --> 01:18:51,980
傑克丹尼爾加冰塊
Double
Jack Daniels on the rocks.

998
01:18:52,450 --> 01:18:55,647
給我朋友一杯雪莉雞尾酒
And bring my
young friend here
a Shirley Temple.

999
01:18:56,454 --> 01:18:58,445
等等，你有啤酒嗎？
Hold on.
Do you have beer?

1000
01:18:58,790 --> 01:19:01,054
當然有，你有證件嗎？
Certainly. May I
see some ID?

1001
01:19:01,259 --> 01:19:04,319
你想要一輩子當侍者？
Are you interested
in walkin' the rest
of your life, chappy?

1002
01:19:04,729 --> 01:19:05,718
抱歉，但是…
I'm sorry, sir, but...

1003
01:19:05,864 --> 01:19:09,197
我是這兒的常客
我孩子快廿三了
I'm a regular here.
My boy's going on 23.

1004
01:19:09,467 --> 01:19:10,798
你何不打電話問經理？
吉伯先生是我朋友
Why don't you
call up front,
the office?
Mr. Gilbert,
he's a friend of mine.

1005
01:19:17,409 --> 01:19:18,876
指定要哪個牌子嗎
Any particular beer?

1006
01:19:19,177 --> 01:19:21,907
「史利茲」，沒有的話
Schlitz. No Schlitz?

1007
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:25,278
就要「布雷茲」
沒有「布雷茲」的話
Blatz. No Blatz?

1008
01:19:25,884 --> 01:19:27,146
就隨便了
Lmprovise.

1009
01:19:28,286 --> 01:19:32,357
一定讓您滿意
謝了
I'll do my best, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.

1010
01:19:32,357 --> 01:19:35,019
你總算像人了！喝啤酒呢！
You're human, Charlie.
Beer?

1011
01:19:38,497 --> 01:19:40,158
我們在跟誰一塊兒喝？
Who are we
drinking with?

1012
01:19:40,632 --> 01:19:44,432
上好香皂和水的清香
從那兒飄來
I'm getting
a nice soap-and-water
feeling from down there.

1013
01:19:52,377 --> 01:19:54,242
哦，女性
A female.

1014
01:19:54,646 --> 01:20:00,050
「女性」就表示你對她
有意思
"Female"?
You callin' her female
must mean you like her
or you wouldn't be so casual.

1015
01:20:03,955 --> 01:20:04,751
她一個人？
Is she alone?

1016
01:20:05,290 --> 01:20:06,416
一個人
Yeah, she's alone.

1017
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,952
好戲要開鑼囉，栗色頭髮？
Things are heatin' up.
Chestnut hair?

1018
01:20:12,898 --> 01:20:15,366
棕色，淡棕色
Brown, light brown.

1019
01:20:17,669 --> 01:20:18,658
廿二？
我不太會猜年齡
Twenty-two?
What am I,
a guy at a carnival?

1020
01:20:24,376 --> 01:20:27,038
活到老，「泡」到老
The day we stop lookin',
Charlie, is the day we die.

1021
01:20:28,246 --> 01:20:29,235
行動
Move.

1022
01:20:29,648 --> 01:20:31,115
往哪？
你知道哪兒
Where?
You know where, son.

1023
01:20:31,516 --> 01:20:32,847
別害羞
Don't be coy, Charlie.

1024
01:20:35,587 --> 01:20:38,317
她是為你造的
我有預感
This woman is
made for you.
I can feel it.

1025
01:20:39,057 --> 01:20:40,649
漂亮死了吧？
Goddamn beautiful,
isn't she?

1026
01:20:41,326 --> 01:20:44,318
不壞
賓果！你還活著
She's not bad.
Bingo! The boy's alive.

1027
01:20:45,597 --> 01:20:48,259
來吧，孩子，大步走
Come on, son,
perambulate.

1028
01:20:49,334 --> 01:20:50,528
大步走
Perambulate.

1029
01:21:00,479 --> 01:21:04,142
打擾您了，小姐
介意我們和您同坐嗎？
Excuse me, se·orita,
do you mind if
we join you?

1030
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:07,741
我有個您被忽視的感覺呢
I'm feelin' you're
being neglected.

1031
01:21:09,488 --> 01:21:11,217
我在等人
I'm expecting somebody.

1032
01:21:13,425 --> 01:21:14,551
他馬上就來？
Instantly?

1033
01:21:16,328 --> 01:21:18,990
不，但隨時會到
隨時會到
No, but any minute now.
Any minute?

1034
01:21:19,431 --> 01:21:21,763
有些人一分鐘內過盡一生
Some people live
a lifetime
in a minute.

1035
01:21:23,301 --> 01:21:24,290
現在你做什麼？
What are you doin'
right now?

1036
01:21:25,737 --> 01:21:27,466
我等他
I'm waiting for him.

1037
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:31,002
介不介意我們陪你等？
Would you mind if
we waited with you,

1038
01:21:32,244 --> 01:21:35,304
好叫登徒子別煩你
just to keep
the womanizers
from bothering you?

1039
01:21:39,151 --> 01:21:40,413
不，我不介意
No, I don't mind.

1040
01:21:41,153 --> 01:21:41,949
謝謝
Thank you.
Charlie.

1041
01:21:50,862 --> 01:21:53,854
空氣中有香味兒
You know, I detect
a fragrance
in the air.

1042
01:21:54,199 --> 01:21:55,530
別告訴我什麼牌子
Don't tell me
what it is.

1043
01:21:57,269 --> 01:21:58,736
「歐吉維姐妹」香皂
Ogilvie Sisters
soap.

1044
01:22:00,939 --> 01:22:02,133
真不可思議！
That's amazing.

1045
01:22:02,474 --> 01:22:04,203
我做的正是不可思議之舉
I'm in the
amazing business.

1046
01:22:04,809 --> 01:22:06,470
正是「歐吉維姐妹」香皂
It is
Ogilvie Sisters
soap.

1047
01:22:07,479 --> 01:22:09,879
聖誕節祖母送我的
My grandmother gave me
three bars for Christmas.

1048
01:22:10,148 --> 01:22:13,948
我對你祖母著迷了！
她一定會喜歡查理
I'm crazy about
your grandmother.
I think she'd have
liked Charlie, too.

1049
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:17,484
別理他
你的芳名是？
Don't pay any
attention to him.
What's your name?

1050
01:22:18,356 --> 01:22:19,015
唐娜
Donna.

1051
01:22:19,491 --> 01:22:22,688
唐娜，我是法蘭克
這位是…
Donna? I'm Frank.
This here is...

1052
01:22:22,794 --> 01:22:23,590
查理
Charlie.

1053
01:22:24,229 --> 01:22:25,958
她喜歡你
Yes.
She likes you.

1054
01:22:27,232 --> 01:22:32,169
查理有煩惱
他看來如何？
Charlie's having
a difficult weekend.
He's going
through a crisis.
How does he look like
he's holding up?

1055
01:22:33,438 --> 01:22:35,167
看來還好
He looks fine to me.

1056
01:22:35,373 --> 01:22:37,364
噢，她真的喜歡你
查理
She does like you,
Charlie.

1057
01:22:43,248 --> 01:22:44,237
好，唐娜…
So, Donna,

1058
01:22:47,552 --> 01:22:48,541
你跳探戈嗎？
do you tango?

1059
01:22:49,854 --> 01:22:52,254
以前想要學，但是…
No. I wanted to
learn once, but...

1060
01:22:52,991 --> 01:22:53,980
但是？
But?

1061
01:22:55,794 --> 01:22:57,125
麥可不想
But Michael
didn't want to.

1062
01:22:57,629 --> 01:23:00,757
麥可，你在等的人
Michael.
The one you're
waiting for.

1063
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:04,532
麥可覺得探戈很可笑
Michael thinks
the tango's hysterical.

1064
01:23:04,936 --> 01:23:06,927
嗯，我想麥可很可笑
I think Michael's
hysterical.

1065
01:23:08,206 --> 01:23:11,198
別理他…
我好像說過了？
Don't pay any
attention to him.
Did I already
say that?

1066
01:23:14,212 --> 01:23:15,543
多美的笑聲
What a beautiful laugh.

1067
01:23:17,882 --> 01:23:18,940
謝謝，法蘭克
Thank you, Frank.

1068
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:26,751
你想不想學探戈？
Would you like
to learn to tango,
Donna?

1069
01:23:30,695 --> 01:23:31,684
現在？
Right now?

1070
01:23:33,398 --> 01:23:37,664
免費服務，如何？
I'm offering you
my services,
free of charge.
What do you say?

1071
01:23:41,906 --> 01:23:43,635
我有點怕
I think I'd be
a little afraid.

1072
01:23:45,010 --> 01:23:46,136
怕什麼？
Of what?

1073
01:23:47,646 --> 01:23:49,637
踩錯步
Afraid of making
a mistake.

1074
01:23:51,249 --> 01:23:54,377
探戈裡無所謂錯步的
不像人生…
No mistakes
in the tango, Donna.
Not like life.

1075
01:23:55,053 --> 01:23:57,783
它簡單，所以才棒
It's simple.
That's what makes
the tango so great.

1076
01:23:57,856 --> 01:24:01,519
要是踏錯步或絆倒了
繼續跳
If you make a mistake,
get all tangled up,
just tango on.

1077
01:24:04,663 --> 01:24:05,652
何不試試？
Why don't you try?

1078
01:24:10,802 --> 01:24:11,791
好嗎？
Will you try it?

1079
01:24:14,205 --> 01:24:16,002
好，我試試
All right.
I'll give it a try.

1080
01:24:17,742 --> 01:24:18,868
扶住我，孩子
Hold me down, son.

1081
01:24:26,017 --> 01:24:27,006
你的手？
Your arm?
Charlie,

1082
01:24:32,957 --> 01:24:34,618
給我一點方位
I'm gonna need some
coordinates here, son.

1083
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:41,632
舞池大約二十尺乘三十尺
你在舞池這邊
The floor's about
20 by 30,
and you're at
the long end.

1084
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:45,033
外圍有些桌子…
樂隊也在那
There's some tables
on the outside and
the band's
on the right.

1085
01:27:25,737 --> 01:27:29,138
你跳的好極了！
Frank, you are
one incredible
dancer.

1086
01:27:32,410 --> 01:27:34,071
查理跳的才好呢
Wait'll you see
Charlie dance.

1087
01:27:35,413 --> 01:27:37,074
他撒謊，我不會跳
He's a liar.
I don't dance.

1088
01:27:37,348 --> 01:27:42,877
事實上，他不僅會跳
還能唱
Isn't he a charmer,
though?
Truth is,
not only can he dance,
but he'll sing you
a hell of a tune.

1089
01:27:42,954 --> 01:27:46,287
他會學鳥叫
還會模仿明星
He can do bird calls
and imitate Bela Lugosi.
Hi, honey.
Hi.
Hey.

1090
01:27:48,626 --> 01:27:51,356
麥可，這是法蘭克，查理
Michael, this is Frank
and this is Charlie.

1091
01:27:51,496 --> 01:27:53,361
抱歉我遲到了
Hi, Frank, Charlie.
Sorry I'm late.

1092
01:27:53,431 --> 01:27:57,561
沒關係
有兩位先生陪著我
That's okay.
These two gentlemen
entertained me,

1093
01:27:57,902 --> 01:27:59,233
時間一下子打發了
and time flew.

1094
01:27:59,771 --> 01:28:02,569
你女友的探戈跳得好極了
Your girl is a hell
of a tango dancer.

1095
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:05,968
你總算找到人
陪你跳探戈了
At last,
you found someone
to tango with.

1096
01:28:06,244 --> 01:28:07,176
太棒了！
That's terrific!

1097
01:28:07,445 --> 01:28:08,776
我們握個手
Let me shake your hand.

1098
01:28:09,314 --> 01:28:10,645
不，是法蘭克陪我跳的
No, it was Frank.

1099
01:28:10,915 --> 01:28:12,576
那我握你們倆的手
Hell, I'll shake
both your hands!

1100
01:28:14,285 --> 01:28:17,083
親愛的，我們得走了
This looks like
the place, but
we gotta go.

1101
01:28:17,155 --> 01:28:19,817
和戴瑞和卡洛約好了
We got a date with
Darryl and Carol
in the Village.

1102
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:22,050
帳單…
我的榮幸
Do you have a check?
Michael, please.
My pleasure.

1103
01:28:25,363 --> 01:28:26,455
不不，我來付
No, no. I got this.

1104
01:28:26,531 --> 01:28:29,659
把貴手拿開吧，我來
Michael, get your hand
outta your pocket.
I'll take it. Really.

1105
01:28:30,835 --> 01:28:31,824
讓我請吧
Allow me.

1106
01:28:34,706 --> 01:28:38,437
謝謝了，再會
Why, thank you.
Bye, guys.
Bye.

1107
01:28:47,452 --> 01:28:50,785
「戴瑞和卡洛」，是哦
Darryl and Carol.
Yeah.

1108
01:28:59,230 --> 01:29:02,222
17-E，她在等您呢
It's apartment 17E,
Colonel.
She's expecting you.

1109
01:29:02,567 --> 01:29:05,764
別擔心，她是最紅的
Don't worry about a thing.
She's the cr·me de la cr·me.

1110
01:29:06,571 --> 01:29:11,235
德國副議長找過她
現在他想移民呢
My buddy took
the Vice Chancellor
of Germany to her.
Now he wants to
immigrate to this country.

1111
01:29:11,643 --> 01:29:13,110
辦得好！
You did good, hombre.

1112
01:29:16,114 --> 01:29:17,775
我的頭髮，還好吧
My hair, how is it?

1113
01:29:18,983 --> 01:29:19,972
完美
It's perfect.

1114
01:29:23,855 --> 01:29:26,050
配紅領巾可以嗎？
I got the red
foulard okay,
didn't I?

1115
01:29:26,324 --> 01:29:27,985
是啊，深紅色
Yeah,
real dark red.

1116
01:29:28,092 --> 01:29:31,255
是葡萄酒色
她們愛死了！
Burgundy, Charlie.
Burgundy. They love it.

1117
01:29:33,498 --> 01:29:34,487
港灣刮鬍水
Bay rum.

1118
01:29:37,068 --> 01:29:38,057
溫莎結
Windsor knot.

1119
01:29:41,306 --> 01:29:42,967
摸摸我的心
That's my heart
I'm feelin'.

1120
01:29:53,484 --> 01:29:54,143
走了
I'm off.

1121
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:13,959
可以打長途電話嗎？
Can you get long
distance on this?

1122
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:15,970
請自便
And how. Be my guest.

1123
01:30:27,685 --> 01:30:28,879
「甘蔗叢」賓館
Sugarbush Lodge.

1124
01:30:28,986 --> 01:30:31,853
請接喬治威利斯
請稍等
Hi. George Willis, please?
One moment, please.
Hello?
Harry?

1125
01:30:35,526 --> 01:30:38,188
哈瑞？
小查，你好嗎？
Chas, how are you?

1126
01:30:38,262 --> 01:30:41,459
我們正要帶喬治去機場
You just caught us.
We're about to shoot
George over to the airport.

1127
01:30:41,532 --> 01:30:43,193
他為什麼要去機場？
慢著，你和他說吧
Why is George going
to the airport?
Hold on. Maybe
you should talk
to the man himself.
Chas.

1128
01:30:50,074 --> 01:30:50,938
嗨，喬治
Yeah. Hi, George.

1129
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:52,475
晚一步我就走了
You just caught me.

1130
01:30:52,543 --> 01:30:55,205
我知道，你要去哪？
That's what Harry said.
Where you goin'?

1131
01:30:55,279 --> 01:30:56,268
回家
Home.

1132
01:30:56,614 --> 01:30:57,603
波士頓？
To Boston?

1133
01:30:57,882 --> 01:31:00,749
嗯，祝我好運
Catching the puddle·umper.
Keep your fingers crossed.

1134
01:31:00,818 --> 01:31:03,150
你回家做什麼？
What are you
going home for?

1135
01:31:05,890 --> 01:31:09,826
我想…
老垂也太不講理了
I was thinking.
This asshole, Trask?
He's making no sense at all.

1136
01:31:11,095 --> 01:31:14,826
得有人和他說說
我爸是五九年那屆的
Somebody's gotta talk to him.
My father was class of '59.

1137
01:31:14,899 --> 01:31:18,491
你爸爸？
我們約好不告訴父母的
Your father?
I thought we were gonna
keep our parents outta this.

1138
01:31:18,970 --> 01:31:23,134
老垂發瘋了！真瘋了
一定要有人出面
我爸又是主要捐款人
This guy Trask
is out of control, Chas.
Out of control!
Somebody's gotta
talk to him.
My father's
a major fundraiser,
you know.

1139
01:31:28,379 --> 01:31:29,311
我沒有說
No, I didn't.

1140
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:34,841
別緊張，我爸會解決
我要走了，還好吧？
Right.
Relax. He'll get us
off the hook.
I gotta go.
Everything all right?

1141
01:31:35,052 --> 01:31:35,848
還好
Sure.

1142
01:31:36,487 --> 01:31:39,285
週一見，拜
I'll see you Monday.
Goodbye.
Bye.
Good night, sir.
Good night.
Hiya, Charlie.
Watch the door.

1143
01:32:42,453 --> 01:32:44,250
好漂亮的女人
What a beautiful woman.

1144
01:32:58,602 --> 01:32:59,534
哈囉
Hello, there.

1145
01:33:00,337 --> 01:33:01,998
你看到我看到了的？
Do you
see what I see?

1146
01:33:02,339 --> 01:33:04,933
是，有問題…
Yeah.
Either there's
something wrong,

1147
01:33:05,476 --> 01:33:07,341
不然就是我醉了
or we got the world's
worst hangover.

1148
01:33:07,878 --> 01:33:09,004
進來
Won't you come in?

1149
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:12,012
銀行搶案的照片呢？
We hear
you got a picture of
the bank robbery.

1150
01:33:30,201 --> 01:33:31,190
中校？
Colonel?

1151
01:33:45,883 --> 01:33:47,214
你還好吧？
Colonel,
you all right?

1152
01:33:49,453 --> 01:33:50,442
幹嘛？
What is it?

1153
01:33:54,458 --> 01:33:58,121
下午了，一早上你都在睡
It's after noon.
You've been sleeping
all morning.

1154
01:33:59,797 --> 01:34:00,786
又怎樣？
So what?

1155
01:34:03,968 --> 01:34:04,957
沒什麼
I don't know.
I thought...

1156
01:34:10,608 --> 01:34:14,807
昨晚我和喬治通電話
他的…
I talked to George
last night.

1157
01:34:14,945 --> 01:34:18,813
他爸爸是很有勢力的校友
His father's a big-deal
alumnus at school.
He's got a lot of pull.

1158
01:34:20,751 --> 01:34:21,740
是嗎？
Really?

1159
01:34:24,421 --> 01:34:28,289
他要去和校長談
Yeah, he's gonna talk
to the headmaster.

1160
01:34:29,827 --> 01:34:31,954
喬治說他爸爸
能幫我們脫險
George thinks he might
be able to get us
off the hook.

1161
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:34,491
「幫我們脫險」
"Get us off the hook."

1162
01:34:35,633 --> 01:34:37,294
他這麼說的
Yeah, that's what he said.

1163
01:34:39,303 --> 01:34:41,294
當心他所謂的「我們」
Watch the "us" part.

1164
01:34:44,375 --> 01:34:46,104
要不要去逛逛？
Colonel, don't you wanna
get up and do something?
Colonel?

1165
01:34:53,851 --> 01:34:55,716
查理，你要幹什麼？
Charlie, what do
you want?

1166
01:34:56,453 --> 01:34:58,114
不曉得，但是…
I don't know,

1167
01:34:58,923 --> 01:35:00,584
我被你弄的很緊張
but you're making
me nervous.

1168
01:35:04,128 --> 01:35:06,596
我的皮夾在抽屜裡
My wallet is
on the dresser.

1169
01:35:07,998 --> 01:35:09,465
拿走你的機票…
Take out your plane ticket

1170
01:35:10,801 --> 01:35:15,464
和四百塊錢
退伍津帖
and $400
mustering-out pay, plus

1171
01:35:17,107 --> 01:35:20,508
外加機場到學校的車資
airport-to-school taxi.

1172
01:35:22,847 --> 01:35:25,577
中校，不必急
Colonel, it's no rush.
I mean, I can...

1173
01:35:26,817 --> 01:35:28,011
我可以多待一會兒
I could stay for a while.

1174
01:35:28,219 --> 01:35:30,687
查理，你已給了我一天
Charlie, you already
gave me a day.

1175
01:35:32,156 --> 01:35:35,148
就為了那天，我永遠感激
And for that day,
I am eternally grateful.

1176
01:35:37,828 --> 01:35:42,296
但現在…
我另有計劃
But right now
I have other plans.

1177
01:35:43,434 --> 01:35:45,095
什麼計劃？
What other plans
do you have?

1178
01:35:47,705 --> 01:35:49,036
去死，孩子
To die, son.

1179
01:35:51,175 --> 01:35:52,301
中校，你…
Colonel, you're...

1180
01:35:53,644 --> 01:35:55,635
你今天可不准去死
Come on, Colonel,
you're not gonna die today.

1181
01:35:57,181 --> 01:35:59,513
查理，把你的手給我
Charlie,
give me your hand.

1182
01:36:04,121 --> 01:36:06,112
你走，好嗎？
You go now, boy.
Okay?

1183
01:36:08,525 --> 01:36:10,789
你走，留我一個…
You go. Just...

1184
01:36:14,131 --> 01:36:15,792
在這裡睡覺
Just leave me
sleep here.

1185
01:36:17,735 --> 01:36:20,727
我們再試試，好嗎？
Look...
Can we start
over, please?

1186
01:36:22,139 --> 01:36:23,470
你想做什麼？
What do you feel
like doin' today, huh?

1187
01:36:25,209 --> 01:36:29,202
你看，陽光燦爛
天氣美好
Look at this.
The sun is shining!
It's a beautiful day.
Let's...

1188
01:36:34,018 --> 01:36:36,350
你不會想掃我興致吧
Colonel, I know you don't
want to be a party poop,

1189
01:36:37,087 --> 01:36:40,887
我們出去活動一下
兜兜風
so let's go out
and do something.
Let's go for a ride.

1190
01:36:46,430 --> 01:36:47,761
對，兜兜風
Yeah, a ride.

1191
01:36:50,301 --> 01:36:51,290
兜風？
A ride?

1192
01:36:53,570 --> 01:36:55,231
嗯，好不好？
Yeah, Colonel Slade,
what do you say?

1193
01:36:55,773 --> 01:36:57,434
我們去兜風
Let's go
for a ride, huh?

1194
01:37:05,582 --> 01:37:07,243
哪一種兜風法？
What kind of ride?

1195
01:37:09,353 --> 01:37:11,821
嗯，這張駕照有效
Yeah, this is a valid
Oregon driver's license,

1196
01:37:12,189 --> 01:37:15,317
信得過的顧客可以試
泰德蘿莎
and we let appropriate
customers test-drive
the Testarossa.

1197
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:19,922
你只有十七歲
同伴又失明
這我們無能為力
But you're 17, with
a blind companion.
That we don't do.

1198
01:37:19,997 --> 01:37:22,431
這車值十九萬
This is a $100,000
piece of machinery.

1199
01:37:22,499 --> 01:37:23,898
我不能讓它這樣出門
I'm not letting it
out this door.

1200
01:37:24,668 --> 01:37:25,862
那這部呢？
How about this one
over here?

1201
01:37:26,270 --> 01:37:28,534
那是加布雷提
That's a Cabriolet T.
The same deal.

1202
01:37:28,939 --> 01:37:33,205
我不能讓小孩開走
十一萬的車
You think I'll let
an unaccompanied kid
get in a $110,000 car?

1203
01:37:33,277 --> 01:37:35,541
他會有伴的
He will not be
unaccompanied.

1204
01:37:36,447 --> 01:37:39,439
我會和他一起試車
我是他父親
I'll be with him.
I'm his father.

1205
01:37:39,817 --> 01:37:41,079
你是他父親？
You're his father?
Yes.

1206
01:37:43,220 --> 01:37:45,814
這樣吧
我帶你父親去試車
I have an idea. Why don't
I take your father
for a test drive?

1207
01:37:46,090 --> 01:37:47,751
你的業績要多少？
What's your quota, Freddie?

1208
01:37:48,192 --> 01:37:49,784
不勞費心
Don't worry
about my quota.
I do well.

1209
01:37:50,027 --> 01:37:51,892
這個月你賣了幾輛法拉利？
How many Ferraris
you sold this month?

1210
01:37:52,096 --> 01:37:53,893
數目不重要
八０年代結束了
That's not relevant
to this discussion.
Freddie,
the '·0s are over.

1211
01:37:57,034 --> 01:37:59,696
這些奢侈品不好送出門吧？
Are you tryin' to tell me
these things are walkin'
outta the store?

1212
01:37:59,770 --> 01:38:03,896
這可是法拉利哦
汽車界的最佳出品
This is a Ferrari, sir,
the finest machinery made
in the automobile industry.

1213
01:38:04,108 --> 01:38:06,838
你要那麼喜歡它
何不跟它睡
If you like it that much,
why don't you sleep with it?
Why are you sellin' it?

1214
01:38:07,177 --> 01:38:08,644
我很願意幫忙，但是…
I'd love to
accommodate you...

1215
01:38:08,712 --> 01:38:11,374
如果它符合我的期望…
If this car performs
the way I expect it to,

1216
01:38:11,982 --> 01:38:16,112
你會拿到一張
十萬一千元的支票
you will get
a check of $101,000,
and change,

1217
01:38:16,186 --> 01:38:17,312
就明天一早！
when you come in
here tomorrow morning.

1218
01:38:17,721 --> 01:38:22,055
售價是十萬九千九百
五十塊，外加稅
It's $100,000,
plus $050,
plus tax.

1219
01:38:22,126 --> 01:38:23,923
佛迪，為了你…
Freddie, for you

1220
01:38:25,195 --> 01:38:27,186
我加到十萬七千元
107 all in,

1221
01:38:27,398 --> 01:38:30,390
外送一箱香檳
讓你配剩火雞喝
plus a case of champagne
to go with your
leftover turkey.

1222
01:38:32,202 --> 01:38:34,864
如何？別擔心這孩子
What do you say?
Don't worry about
the boy.

1223
01:38:35,005 --> 01:38:38,065
他開得穩的可以在引擎上煮蛋
He drives so smooth,
you can boil an egg
on the engine.

1224
01:38:38,742 --> 01:38:41,540
還車的時候，我來剝蛋
When we bring
the car back, I'll peel
the egg for ya.

1225
01:38:43,013 --> 01:38:45,743
你把我逗笑了
但車不能給你
Listen, you made me laugh,
but I can't let
the car go out.

1226
01:38:48,485 --> 01:38:49,679
要不要押金？
Want a deposit?

1227
01:38:50,421 --> 01:38:52,753
我們不搞分期付款的
先生
This is not an
installment item, sir.

1228
01:38:56,226 --> 01:38:59,889
你又不是生手
Freddie, you're
no spring chicken.

1229
01:39:01,832 --> 01:39:04,164
你知道同事叫我什麼嗎？
老黑爵
為什麼還留我呢？
You know what they call me
at the home office?
"The Grey Ghost."
You know why they
still keep me around?

1230
01:39:08,505 --> 01:39:11,838
因為後生小輩
賣不掉法拉利
There's no kid here
that can move a Ferrari
like I can.

1231
01:39:12,042 --> 01:39:17,036
從東岸到西岸人盡皆知
I'm known from
coast to coast
like butter and toast.
Ask anybody about
Freddie Bisco.

1232
01:39:17,247 --> 01:39:19,977
進來一部…
我就賣掉一部
When I get a Ferrari...
Out the door!

1233
01:39:21,785 --> 01:39:23,446
你才逗我笑呢，佛迪
You just made
me laugh, Freddie.
Yeah?

1234
01:39:25,456 --> 01:39:26,445
兩千塊
2,000.

1235
01:39:27,991 --> 01:39:30,118
你不拿，我可要哭了
Unless you take it,
you're gonna make me cry.

1236
01:39:34,131 --> 01:39:35,530
我也是老黑爵
I'm a grey ghost, too.

1237
01:39:47,411 --> 01:39:50,412
看吧？
很過癮吧？
See? This is fun,
isn't it?

1238
01:40:05,195 --> 01:40:06,526
放空檔
推二檔，放離合器
Drop her into neutral.
Slide her into second.
Pop the clutch.

1239
01:40:48,197 --> 01:40:49,186
開直
就這樣開，直點
開直
Straight.
Hold it right
like that.
Feel it?
That's straight.
It's a straight street,
so keep it straight.

1240
01:40:58,140 --> 01:40:59,129
開直
Keep it straight.

1241
01:40:59,675 --> 01:41:01,108
開直就沒意思了
No fun just
to keep it straight.

1242
01:41:01,210 --> 01:41:04,611
要猛一點才夠勁
You've got to move
a little bit,
feel the road.

1243
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:07,547
拜託，就這麼開，好嗎？
Please? Just like this.
All right? There you go.

1244
01:41:08,217 --> 01:41:09,616
穩穩的
Take it nice and easy.

1245
01:41:10,953 --> 01:41:11,942
喜歡嗎？
Do you like this?

1246
01:41:16,358 --> 01:41:18,826
放慢點，開太快了
Slow it down
a little, Colonel.
You're goin' a little fast.

1247
01:41:20,563 --> 01:41:22,554
中校，放慢點
Colonel, slow it down.

1248
01:41:23,566 --> 01:41:25,033
我的腳出問題了
Something's happened
to my foot!

1249
01:41:27,303 --> 01:41:28,292
慢點，拜託
Slow it down, please.

1250
01:41:28,370 --> 01:41:30,838
分明有另一檔可以用
Hold on. I think
I've got another gear.

1251
01:41:32,074 --> 01:41:32,733
史中校！
Colonel Slade?
Hoo-ah!

1252
01:41:37,246 --> 01:41:37,837
看路！
Watch out!

1253
01:41:42,551 --> 01:41:43,677
你要害我們送命！
You'll get us killed!

1254
01:41:43,786 --> 01:41:46,118
別怪我，我看不到
Don't blame me,
Charlie, I can't see!

1255
01:41:48,657 --> 01:41:49,919
中校，慢點
天啊，耶穌基督
Colonel,
slow it down!
Oh, Jesus!

1256
01:42:02,671 --> 01:42:05,139
看看這個寶貝怎麼轉彎
Now let's see how
this baby corners.

1257
01:42:05,374 --> 01:42:06,033
轉彎？
Corners?

1258
01:42:06,342 --> 01:42:08,207
對啊，給我信號
Yeah. Say when.

1259
01:42:08,477 --> 01:42:09,273
什麼？
Say when what?

1260
01:42:09,945 --> 01:42:10,934
轉彎信號
Say when to turn.

1261
01:42:11,146 --> 01:42:12,545
你不能轉彎
Colonel,
you can't turn the car.

1262
01:42:13,015 --> 01:42:14,539
在哪轉，查理？
Where's
the turn, Charlie?

1263
01:42:15,417 --> 01:42:18,614
三點鐘方位？兩點
右？歪？
3 o'clock? 2 o'clock?
Right oblique? Right face?

1264
01:42:18,754 --> 01:42:20,346
快啊，說啊
Come on! Talk to me!

1265
01:42:21,824 --> 01:42:22,882
左
It's left, I guess.

1266
01:42:23,158 --> 01:42:25,626
我知道轉左，現在？
Left. I knew it. Okay. Now?

1267
01:42:27,563 --> 01:42:29,155
不是不是！
No, no! Not now! Not now!

1268
01:42:30,733 --> 01:42:31,392
現在？
Now?

1269
01:42:32,434 --> 01:42:33,298
拜託
Colonel, please!

1270
01:42:33,502 --> 01:42:35,493
我要轉了
I'm gonna do it anyway,
all right?

1271
01:42:35,838 --> 01:42:37,567
不管你同不同意
Whether you say so
or not, here we go!

1272
01:42:37,706 --> 01:42:40,338
好，等等
等一下
Okay! Wait, wait, wait!
Just wait!

1273
01:42:40,409 --> 01:42:42,502
我要轉了…要轉了…
Here I go.

1274
01:42:42,711 --> 01:42:44,002
慢著
轉！
Wait... Now!

1275
01:42:51,053 --> 01:42:53,783
我轉成了！噢，查理！
I did it! Charlie!

1276
01:42:55,524 --> 01:42:57,651
你的同伴很快樂！
You're ridin' with
one very happy man!

1277
01:43:00,129 --> 01:43:01,061
你還得再轉
Turn again!

1278
01:43:01,330 --> 01:43:02,126
要仔細
Be specific, son.

1279
01:43:03,432 --> 01:43:04,228
向左，轉！
Left now!
Okay.

1280
01:43:10,873 --> 01:43:13,797
愛死這遊戲了！
愛死了！
I love this! I love it!

1281
01:43:15,210 --> 01:43:16,541
試試最高速
Shall we take it to the max?

1282
01:43:17,146 --> 01:43:18,135
我要下車
Let me out.

1283
01:43:21,083 --> 01:43:22,744
媽的！條子
Shit!
The yellow flag.

1284
01:43:23,752 --> 01:43:26,414
我還沒開始衝呢
I haven't even
opened her up yet.
Which way's the curb?

1285
01:43:26,822 --> 01:43:29,290
靠邊停，放慢，中校
Pull over. Slow down!
Slow down.

1286
01:43:29,358 --> 01:43:30,347
好吧，來了
I'm doin' it.

1287
01:43:30,426 --> 01:43:32,485
放慢
Pull over to
the curb, here.
Slow down.

1288
01:43:32,695 --> 01:43:33,491
我知道
Yep. Got it.

1289
01:43:47,242 --> 01:43:48,903
我幾年來都沒拿罰單
Haven't had
a ticket in years.

1290
01:43:52,848 --> 01:43:54,042
我來應付
I'll do the talking.

1291
01:44:00,389 --> 01:44:01,788
駕照和車牌
License
and registration.

1292
01:44:14,670 --> 01:44:15,932
在試這部小寶貝？
Are you test-driving
this baby?

1293
01:44:16,739 --> 01:44:17,865
很神吧？
Don't she purr, though?

1294
01:44:19,008 --> 01:44:20,475
時速七十英哩？
At 70 miles an hour?

1295
01:44:21,076 --> 01:44:23,067
你該看看她一百廿五的英姿
You should hear
her at 125.

1296
01:44:25,214 --> 01:44:26,545
駕照呢？
Where's your license?

1297
01:44:28,751 --> 01:44:32,414
在車行
還車的時候才拿
At the dealer's.
They give it back
when you return the car.

1298
01:44:33,956 --> 01:44:35,082
你有身份證？
You got ID?

1299
01:44:35,491 --> 01:44:36,287
可不是
You bet.

1300
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:39,349
在此
Indeed.

1301
01:44:43,632 --> 01:44:45,429
史雷德中校
Lieutenant Colonel Slade.

1302
01:44:46,235 --> 01:44:47,361
你呢，警員？
And you, soldier?

1303
01:44:48,771 --> 01:44:51,239
我是高爾警官
The name is
Police Officer Gore.

1304
01:44:53,042 --> 01:44:54,703
你執勤認真
Doin' a hell
of a job, Gore.

1305
01:44:55,244 --> 01:44:56,905
你也不差，中校
And so are you,
Colonel.

1306
01:44:58,414 --> 01:44:59,346
小孩是誰？
Who's the kid?

1307
01:45:00,916 --> 01:45:02,247
小犬，查理
My boy Charlie.

1308
01:45:02,851 --> 01:45:06,787
一直叫我開她出來
能讓他失望嗎？
He kept tellin' me
to "let her out."
What was I gonna do,
disappoint him?

1309
01:45:07,656 --> 01:45:08,452
當然
Yes.

1310
01:45:12,695 --> 01:45:14,026
這麼辦吧…
Tell you what
I'm gonna do,
Colonel.

1311
01:45:14,730 --> 01:45:17,221
我放你一馬，但有個條件
I'm gonna let you go,
on one condition.

1312
01:45:17,733 --> 01:45:18,529
什麼？
What's that?

1313
01:45:19,268 --> 01:45:21,998
馬上把車送回車行
That you take this rig
straight back to the dealer.

1314
01:45:24,339 --> 01:45:25,328
沒問題
You got it.

1315
01:45:25,741 --> 01:45:26,730
閉嘴
Shut up.

1316
01:45:27,943 --> 01:45:28,932
要這個嗎？
You want this?

1317
01:45:29,678 --> 01:45:30,406
當然
Sure.

1318
01:45:32,081 --> 01:45:32,877
高爾
Gore?

1319
01:45:34,216 --> 01:45:36,480
你的臉孔和聲音我很熟
Your face and
your voice
are familiar.

1320
01:45:36,852 --> 01:45:38,843
加入過丹納的軍官俱樂部嗎？
You ever been
in the officer's
club at Da Nang?

1321
01:45:40,456 --> 01:45:41,115
沒有
No.

1322
01:45:41,790 --> 01:45:42,779
也沒進過陸軍
Never in the Army?

1323
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:46,091
沒有，海岸防衛隊而已
No. Coast Guard.

1324
01:45:46,962 --> 01:45:47,951
老天
Good Lord.

1325
01:45:53,969 --> 01:45:55,834
你爸氣色不錯，查理
Your dad
is looking good,
Charlie.

1326
01:45:56,238 --> 01:45:59,571
就是喜歡開快車…
勸他開慢點
He's got a heavy foot, though.
Tell him to take it light,
all right?

1327
01:46:01,176 --> 01:46:02,507
知道了
I hear ya!
All right.
Thanks.

1328
01:46:17,192 --> 01:46:20,457
下車，不准你再開了
Get out of the car,
because you are not
driving anymore.

1329
01:46:20,529 --> 01:46:22,520
我在暖車罷了
Just keeping this baby
warm, that's all.

1330
01:46:25,134 --> 01:46:26,601
我不開了
I'm not drivin' anymore.
Yes.

1331
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:40,145
扶著我的肩膀
Take my arm.
I'm okay.

1332
01:46:40,415 --> 01:46:41,882
路不平
Colonel,
it's really
bumpy here.

1333
01:46:56,765 --> 01:46:57,754
還好吧？
You all right?
Yeah.

1334
01:47:11,113 --> 01:47:13,104
紅燈，中校，別走
Red light. Hold it.

1335
01:47:19,521 --> 01:47:20,385
等太久了
Taking too long.
Shit! Colonel! Colonel!
Colonel!

1336
01:47:40,209 --> 01:47:41,540
沒事吧？
Shit! You all right?

1337
01:47:43,212 --> 01:47:46,204
你幹什麼你？拿好拐杖啊
What the hell
are you doing?
Take the cane.

1338
01:47:46,415 --> 01:47:48,542
我要尿尿
拿好拐杖
I gotta take a piss.
Take the cane.

1339
01:47:48,617 --> 01:47:49,811
小便不能忍
Happens to
the best of us.

1340
01:47:49,885 --> 01:47:53,343
不能在公園大道尿啊
最好不過
We're on
Park Avenue.
You can't.
Perfect place.

1341
01:47:54,156 --> 01:47:55,487
警察會抓你的
You'll get arrested.

1342
01:47:55,891 --> 01:47:57,222
我從來不亂尿
Never been
housebroken.
Colonel!
Shit!

1343
01:48:00,429 --> 01:48:02,090
你到底怎麼搞的？
What's the matter
with you, Colonel?

1344
01:48:09,238 --> 01:48:12,404
你在幹嘛？
快起來
What are you doing?
Stand up.

1345
01:48:13,842 --> 01:48:14,831
別亂來
Come on.

1346
01:48:15,310 --> 01:48:17,642
我好累，查理
I'm tired, Charlie.
I'm tired.

1347
01:48:20,115 --> 01:48:21,309
讓我握你手臂
Give me your arm.

1348
01:48:22,517 --> 01:48:23,506
你的拐杖
Here's your cane.

1349
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:27,249
帶我回旅館，孩子
Take me back
to the hotel, son.

1350
01:48:33,784 --> 01:48:34,910
總算到家了
Home at last.

1351
01:48:56,807 --> 01:48:57,796
你還好吧？
You all right now?
Yeah.

1352
01:49:05,482 --> 01:49:07,211
要不要上廁所？
Do you want to
use the bathroom?

1353
01:49:07,685 --> 01:49:08,344
不要
No.

1354
01:49:18,028 --> 01:49:20,019
需要什麼嗎？
不要
Can I get you
something?
No.

1355
01:49:24,835 --> 01:49:27,167
你真的沒事？
我很好
You sure you're
all right?
I'm fine, Charlie.

1356
01:49:46,523 --> 01:49:47,854
我可以打電話嗎？
Do you mind if
I use the phone?

1357
01:49:48,859 --> 01:49:49,848
打吧
Go ahead.
Hello?

1358
01:50:10,614 --> 01:50:11,945
請問喬治在嗎？
Hi, is George there,
please?

1359
01:50:12,483 --> 01:50:13,472
小喬還是老喬？
Senior or Junior?

1360
01:50:15,686 --> 01:50:16,482
小喬
Junior.

1361
01:50:17,021 --> 01:50:18,010
哪位？
Who's this?

1362
01:50:18,689 --> 01:50:20,213
他學校的朋友
A friend of his
from school.

1363
01:50:20,291 --> 01:50:24,625
他不能跟任何朋友講話了
Sorry, but George isn't going
to be talking to any friends
from school right now.
Oh.
Goodbye.

1364
01:50:46,583 --> 01:50:48,107
你在瞪我嗎？
Colonel, are you
looking at me?

1365
01:50:51,655 --> 01:50:53,054
我是個瞎子，查理
I'm blind, Charlie.

1366
01:50:59,730 --> 01:51:01,254
我要去睡一會兒
I'm gonna take a nap.

1367
01:51:04,401 --> 01:51:05,595
兜風太久
Too much fresh air.

1368
01:51:08,072 --> 01:51:09,403
那好
It's probably a good idea.

1369
01:51:10,808 --> 01:51:12,139
我扶你進房
Want me to help you
to your room?

1370
01:51:13,811 --> 01:51:14,800
不必
No.

1371
01:51:16,213 --> 01:51:17,202
我睡沙發
Couch.

1372
01:51:18,549 --> 01:51:20,210
我喜歡這張
I like this couch here.

1373
01:51:23,754 --> 01:51:25,745
你真的沒事？
You sure you're
all right, Colonel?

1374
01:51:26,090 --> 01:51:27,216
我頭痛
I got a headache.

1375
01:51:34,098 --> 01:51:37,090
下樓去替我買阿斯匹靈吧
Why don't you go
downstairs, get me
some aspirin?

1376
01:51:37,167 --> 01:51:40,500
好
另外…
Some aspirin.
Yeah. Also...

1377
01:51:43,307 --> 01:51:44,638
再帶根雪茄
I feel like a cigar.

1378
01:51:46,443 --> 01:51:50,971
蒙地奎斯特一號的
Get me a couple of
Montecristos Number One.

1379
01:51:51,048 --> 01:51:52,913
蒙地奎斯特一號
Montecristos
Number One.
Yeah.

1380
01:51:53,517 --> 01:51:55,849
樓下小店不會有
You won't be able
to get 'em at
the newsstand downstairs.

1381
01:51:56,453 --> 01:51:58,114
那你就過街…
So why don't you
go over to

1382
01:51:59,323 --> 01:52:01,791
到街口的唐喜商店買
50th and Fifth,
Dunhill's.

1383
01:52:02,526 --> 01:52:05,051
叫阿諾的在掌櫃
Fella named Arnold there,
in the humidor.

1384
01:52:06,330 --> 01:52:09,322
告訴他是我要的
Tell him
they're for me.

1385
01:52:10,334 --> 01:52:11,323
他知道的
He'll know.

1386
01:53:00,588 --> 01:53:02,249
回來的太快了吧？
You're back
too fast.

1387
01:53:05,526 --> 01:53:07,517
你一定沒替我買雪茄？
You didn't get
my cigars, did you?

1388
01:53:13,067 --> 01:53:14,398
滾開，查理
Get out of
here, Charlie.

1389
01:53:19,473 --> 01:53:20,804
我們已經講清楚了
I thought we had a deal.

1390
01:53:22,009 --> 01:53:26,137
我毀約
我愛毀約，沒告訴過你？
I welched.
I'm a welcher.
Didn't I tell you?

1391
01:53:27,514 --> 01:53:29,982
你說要把所有子彈給我
No, what you told me
was that you gave me
all the bullets.

1392
01:53:31,285 --> 01:53:32,411
騙你的
I lied.

1393
01:53:34,421 --> 01:53:35,888
你是把我騙住了
You could have fooled me.

1394
01:53:36,290 --> 01:53:37,348
可不是
And I did.

1395
01:53:40,561 --> 01:53:44,019
沒有我，你怎麼辦啊？
How you ever
gonna survive in this
world without me?

1396
01:53:48,802 --> 01:53:50,997
把槍給我好嗎？
Why don't you just
give me the gun,
all right?

1397
01:54:00,714 --> 01:54:02,045
你幹什麼？
What are you doing?

1398
01:54:04,184 --> 01:54:06,243
我也會一槍打死你
I'm gonna
shoot you, too.

1399
01:54:09,390 --> 01:54:11,051
反正你已經完了
Your life's
finished anyway.

1400
01:54:12,726 --> 01:54:16,924
喬治會見風轉舵
你也一樣完蛋
Your friend George
is going to sing
like a canary.
And so are you.

1401
01:54:17,331 --> 01:54:19,799
一旦如此，查理寶寶…
And once you've sung,
Charlie, my boy,

1402
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:24,330
你在那乏味的成人隊伍中
you're gonna take
your place on that
long, gray line

1403
01:54:24,405 --> 01:54:26,202
就佔有一席之地了…
of American manhood.

1404
01:54:27,875 --> 01:54:29,866
你也就完了
And you will
be through.

1405
01:54:32,012 --> 01:54:33,411
我不苟同
I'd like to disagree
with you, Colonel.

1406
01:54:33,647 --> 01:54:39,385
你沒資格不苟同
四五手槍在我手裡
你只有粉刺
You're in no
position to disagree
with me, boy.
I got a loaded.45 here.
You got pimples.

1407
01:54:40,354 --> 01:54:42,015
我要把你殺了…
I'm gonna
kill ya, Charlie,

1408
01:54:42,823 --> 01:54:44,916
因為我不能忍受看著你去…
because I can't
bear the thought

1409
01:54:45,025 --> 01:54:46,151
出賣原則
of you sellin' out!

1410
01:54:48,562 --> 01:54:50,689
把槍放下
Put the gun down,
all right, Colonel?

1411
01:54:51,098 --> 01:54:52,087
什麼？
你在下最後通牒？
What? You givin' me
an ultimatum?
No, I'm...

1412
01:54:57,504 --> 01:54:59,495
最後通牒由我來下！
I give the ultimatums!

1413
01:55:01,108 --> 01:55:02,097
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1414
01:55:04,211 --> 01:55:05,872
我道歉
All right? I'm sorry.

1415
01:55:09,383 --> 01:55:10,714
我也道歉
It's all right,

1416
01:55:12,519 --> 01:55:13,508
查理
Charlie.

1417
01:55:18,659 --> 01:55:20,320
你傷了我的心，孩子
You break
my heart, son.

1418
01:55:22,262 --> 01:55:24,059
我這一生…
All my life
I stood up

1419
01:55:25,065 --> 01:55:27,397
反抗任何人，所有事…
to everyone
and everything,

1420
01:55:28,402 --> 01:55:32,494
只有這樣，我才覺得…
自己重要
because it made me
feel important.

1421
01:55:34,608 --> 01:55:37,475
但你卻是為了
你的原則而反抗
You do it
'cause you mean it.

1422
01:55:40,214 --> 01:55:41,943
你很正直
You got
integrity, Charlie.

1423
01:55:46,220 --> 01:55:49,417
我不曉得該打死你
還是收養你
I don't know whether to
shoot you or adopt you.

1424
01:55:52,426 --> 01:55:54,223
很為難，是吧？
Not much of a choice,
is it, sir?

1425
01:55:54,762 --> 01:55:57,094
少耍嘴皮子
Don't get cute now.

1426
01:55:57,431 --> 01:55:59,160
請把槍放下
Could you please
put the gun away?

1427
01:55:59,433 --> 01:56:00,764
我在問你問題
I asked you
a question.

1428
01:56:01,769 --> 01:56:04,431
你要不要我收養你？
Do you want me
to adopt you,
or don't you?

1429
01:56:05,773 --> 01:56:06,899
請放下槍…
Please? I mean...

1430
01:56:08,909 --> 01:56:10,900
你只是情緒低落
You're just in a slump
right now.

1431
01:56:11,645 --> 01:56:12,634
情緒低落？
Slump?

1432
01:56:15,315 --> 01:56:16,976
不是，查理
No slump, Charlie.

1433
01:56:19,453 --> 01:56:20,784
我是壞人
I'm bad.

1434
01:56:23,791 --> 01:56:25,452
不，我不很壞
I'm not bad. No.

1435
01:56:28,328 --> 01:56:29,317
我爛掉了
I'm rotten.

1436
01:56:33,133 --> 01:56:34,122
你不壞
You're not bad.

1437
01:56:37,871 --> 01:56:39,532
只是痛苦而已
You're just in pain.

1438
01:56:45,546 --> 01:56:47,537
你懂什麼叫痛苦？
What do you know
about pain?

1439
01:56:51,351 --> 01:56:55,811
你只不過是大海裡的一隻小魚
You little snail darter
from the Pacific Northwest.

1440
01:56:57,157 --> 01:56:59,148
你媽的懂什麼叫痛苦？
Fuck you know
about pain?

1441
01:57:02,763 --> 01:57:04,230
把槍給我
Let me have the gun,
Colonel.

1442
01:57:05,365 --> 01:57:07,492
想充大人不容易，孩子
No time to grow
a dick, son.

1443
01:57:08,769 --> 01:57:10,760
請把槍給我，中校
Just give me the gun,
all right, Colonel?

1444
01:57:13,407 --> 01:57:15,398
你最好別動
I'm talkin' a
parade ground.

1445
01:57:15,642 --> 01:57:16,301
立正！
Ten-hut!

1446
01:57:20,047 --> 01:57:23,107
小兵，那可是命令
Soldier, that was
a direct order.

1447
01:57:24,918 --> 01:57:25,782
槍給我
Give me the gun.

1448
01:57:30,390 --> 01:57:33,052
要走要留隨便你
You can stay or
you can leave.

1449
01:57:34,261 --> 01:57:35,250
懂嗎？
You understand?

1450
01:57:36,129 --> 01:57:39,462
反正我會用到這玩意兒
Either way, I'm gonna
do this thing.

1451
01:57:41,668 --> 01:57:45,661
現在，你何不避開點
Now why don't
you leave and
spare yourself?

1452
01:57:48,275 --> 01:57:49,606
給我槍，中校
I want your gun,
Colonel.

1453
01:57:59,219 --> 01:58:00,880
我自己來計時
I'm gonna give
myself a count.

1454
01:58:06,627 --> 01:58:09,687
計時有助平衡
You need a count
for balance.

1455
01:58:12,766 --> 01:58:16,224
五、四…
Five...
Four...

1456
01:58:18,105 --> 01:58:19,037
三…
Three...

1457
01:58:21,875 --> 01:58:22,534
二…
Two...

1458
01:58:25,712 --> 01:58:26,701
一
One...

1459
01:58:28,549 --> 01:58:29,208
幹！
Fuck it.

1460
01:58:37,791 --> 01:58:39,122
給我！
Give me! Fuck!

1461
01:58:42,796 --> 01:58:44,923
滾出去！
我不走！
Get out of here!
I'm stayin' right here!

1462
01:58:45,265 --> 01:58:46,459
滾開！
Get outta here!

1463
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:47,726
我不走！
I'm stayin' right here.

1464
01:58:47,801 --> 01:58:49,428
我射爛你腦袋！
I'll blow your
fuckin' head off!

1465
01:58:49,670 --> 01:58:53,197
射呀！你要射就射
快啊！
Then do it!
You want to do it?
Do it! Let's go.

1466
01:59:00,013 --> 01:59:02,004
滾蛋！
Get outta here!

1467
01:59:03,483 --> 01:59:05,610
你搞砸了，又怎樣呢？
You fucked up,
all right? So what?

1468
01:59:05,886 --> 01:59:09,617
人人都會犯錯
你該勇往直前啊
So everybody does it.
Get on with your life,
would ya?

1469
01:59:10,023 --> 01:59:11,354
直什麼前？
What life?

1470
01:59:12,759 --> 01:59:14,420
我早完了！
I got no life!

1471
01:59:16,830 --> 01:59:18,821
我活在黑暗裡
I'm in the dark here!

1472
01:59:20,634 --> 01:59:21,965
你明白嗎？
You understand?

1473
01:59:23,437 --> 01:59:25,098
活在黑暗裡！
I'm in the dark!

1474
01:59:30,644 --> 01:59:36,179
那放棄算了！
儘管自暴自棄吧
我也要放棄了
So give up.
You want to give up, give up.
Because I'm givin' up, too.

1475
01:59:36,550 --> 01:59:38,347
你講的對，我完了
You said I'm through.
You're right,
I am through.

1476
01:59:38,919 --> 01:59:40,716
我們都完了，沒希望了
We're both through.
It's all over.

1477
01:59:41,521 --> 01:59:42,988
媽的就幹吧！
So let's get on with it.
Let's fuckin' do it.

1478
01:59:43,991 --> 01:59:45,982
扣他媽的扳機…
Let's fuckin'
pull the trigger,

1479
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:48,689
你這不可理喻的瞎子！
you miserable
blind motherfucker.

1480
01:59:57,537 --> 01:59:58,526
扣啊！
Pull the trigger.

1481
02:00:01,308 --> 02:00:02,639
預備了…
Here we go, Charlie.

1482
02:00:04,411 --> 02:00:05,400
我好了
I'm ready.

1483
02:00:13,787 --> 02:00:14,981
你不想死
You don't want to die.

1484
02:00:18,125 --> 02:00:19,456
你也不想
And neither do you.

1485
02:00:23,363 --> 02:00:26,025
再給我一個理由
Give me one
reason not to.

1486
02:00:30,604 --> 02:00:35,007
我給你兩個，
你跳探戈和開法拉利帥極了
I'll give you two.
You can dance the tango
and drive a Ferrari better
than anyone I've ever seen.

1487
02:00:41,948 --> 02:00:44,075
你以前沒看過吧
You never seen
anyone do either.

1488
02:00:48,688 --> 02:00:50,019
把槍給我，中校
Give me the gun,
Colonel.

1489
02:01:01,568 --> 02:01:04,230
我該怎麼辦，查理？
Where do I go
from here, Charlie?

1490
02:01:05,772 --> 02:01:08,240
「煩心就跳探戈」
If you're tangled up,
just tango on.

1491
02:01:11,444 --> 02:01:13,435
你要請我跳舞？
You askin' me
to dance, Charlie?

1492
02:01:20,875 --> 02:01:26,336
「你從沒想過要翩然離去？」
Did you ever
have the feelin'
That you wanted to go

1493
02:01:27,082 --> 02:01:31,746
「心裡又渴望留下」
And still had the feelin'
that you wanted to stay?

1494
02:01:48,103 --> 02:01:50,094
你喜歡我的藍制服？
You like my blues,
Charlie?

1495
02:01:53,642 --> 02:01:54,631
很漂亮
Yeah, they're beautiful.

1496
02:01:56,911 --> 02:01:58,378
我穿它們…
I wore these

1497
02:02:00,482 --> 02:02:02,814
參加詹森的就職大典
for Lyndon's
inauguration.

1498
02:02:04,919 --> 02:02:09,721
當然啦…
我們不是最重要的來賓
Of course, we weren't
the number one ball.

1499
02:02:12,594 --> 02:02:14,585
但他過來打招呼了
But he dropped by
anyway.

1500
02:02:17,165 --> 02:02:18,689
請把槍給我
Will you please
give me the gun?

1501
02:02:23,605 --> 02:02:25,266
你在要求一個軍官…
You're askin' an officer

1502
02:02:26,708 --> 02:02:28,835
繳出他的武器
to surrender his sidearm.

1503
02:02:30,645 --> 02:02:34,308
你不必「繳出」
放下就好了
You don't have
to surrender it.
Just put it down
for a little while.

1504
02:02:35,884 --> 02:02:37,351
放下來吧
All right?
Just put it down.

1505
02:02:50,031 --> 02:02:52,022
我需要喝一杯
Boy, I could use
a drink, Charlie.

1506
02:02:55,770 --> 02:02:56,896
咖啡好嗎？
How about a cup of coffee?

1507
02:03:00,442 --> 02:03:03,707
我要三思而行
查理
Too big a leap for me
right now, Charlie.

1508
02:03:03,778 --> 02:03:05,109
也許明天再死
Maybe tomorrow.

1509
02:03:08,183 --> 02:03:12,847
不
還是來杯傑克丹尼爾吧
No, a Mr. John Daniels
would be preferred.

1510
02:03:15,090 --> 02:03:16,614
別摻水，查理
No water,
Charlie.

1511
02:03:19,527 --> 02:03:20,585
不摻水
No water.

1512
02:03:21,463 --> 02:03:22,452
麻煩你了
Please.

1513
02:03:30,839 --> 02:03:41,672
你的酒
對不起
Here's your drink,
Colonel.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1514
02:03:42,283 --> 02:03:44,274
什麼時候幫你鋪床？
What time do you want me
to turn down the bed?

1515
02:03:44,953 --> 02:03:46,614
等會兒吧
Maybe later,
all right?

1516
02:03:46,821 --> 02:03:49,016
他的意思是，小姐…
What he means,
se·orita,

1517
02:03:50,024 --> 02:03:51,685
坐過來
is come right in.

1518
02:03:55,563 --> 02:03:56,359
等會兒
Later, please?

1519
02:03:58,166 --> 02:04:00,157
是的，午安
Yes, sir.
Good afternoon.

1520
02:04:05,039 --> 02:04:06,370
聲音不賴
Nice voice.

1521
02:04:10,845 --> 02:04:12,779
你老想著一件事
Boy, you have
a one-track mind.

1522
02:04:15,049 --> 02:04:17,517
這世上還有別的事嗎？
Is there anything else
in this world, Charlie?

1523
02:04:19,387 --> 02:04:20,376
對你可沒有
Not for you.

1524
02:04:22,123 --> 02:04:24,387
你知道我前進的動力嗎？
You know what's
kept me goin'
all these years?

1525
02:04:25,794 --> 02:04:26,920
就是夢想…
The thought

1526
02:04:29,097 --> 02:04:30,428
有一天…
that one day...

1527
02:04:40,074 --> 02:04:41,132
算了
Never mind.

1528
02:04:42,744 --> 02:04:43,676
什麼？
The what?

1529
02:04:45,747 --> 02:04:46,736
很笨
Silly.

1530
02:04:50,018 --> 02:04:52,350
就是夢想也許有一天…
Just the thought that
maybe one day, I'd...

1531
02:04:56,758 --> 02:04:59,226
能有女人雙臂抱著我…
I could have a woman's arms
wrapped around me,

1532
02:05:01,496 --> 02:05:03,293
雙腿纏著我…
and her legs
wrapped around me.

1533
02:05:06,568 --> 02:05:07,296
然後呢？
And what?

1534
02:05:12,841 --> 02:05:17,244
早晨我睜開眼睛而她還在
That I could wake up
in the morning and
she'd still be there.

1535
02:05:18,646 --> 02:05:20,045
她的味道…
Smell of her.

1536
02:05:21,449 --> 02:05:23,110
甜膩而溫暖
All funky and warm.

1537
02:05:27,922 --> 02:05:29,913
後來我就死心了
I finally gave up on it.

1538
02:05:33,194 --> 02:05:34,718
我不懂這為什麼不可能
我們回新罕布夏以後
我們來物色
I don't know why
you can't have that.
When we get back
to New Hampshire,
I don't know why you
can't find someone.

1539
02:05:44,205 --> 02:05:47,732
你這麼帥，而且…
You're a good-lookin' guy

1540
02:05:48,009 --> 02:05:53,171
你很風趣…
又是旅途良伴
and you're fun to be with
and you're a great
travel companion,

1541
02:05:54,282 --> 02:05:56,682
你敏感，富同情心
sensitive, compassionate.

1542
02:06:00,989 --> 02:06:05,517
查理，你在逗我是吧？
Charlie,
are you fuckin' with me?

1543
02:06:09,631 --> 02:06:10,290
是啊
Yes.

1544
02:06:15,169 --> 02:06:15,828
喂
我們錯過班機了
Yeah?
Hey, Manny.
We missed our plane.

1545
02:06:25,213 --> 02:06:29,013
你的班機，查理
我的機票是單程
Your plane, Charlie.
My ticket was one-way.

1546
02:06:31,330 --> 02:06:33,594
走新英格蘭大道？
New England thruway
all the way, Colonel?

1547
02:06:33,666 --> 02:06:35,463
一路到底
All the way,
Manolo.

1548
02:06:47,480 --> 02:06:49,812
我的預感又來了
I'm gettin' that heavy
feelin' again, Charlie.
Uh...
"Uh..."

1549
02:06:56,556 --> 02:06:58,888
我想你對喬治父子的看法很對
I think you were
right about George
and his father.

1550
02:06:59,892 --> 02:07:01,553
真遺憾
I'm sorry
to hear that.

1551
02:07:02,295 --> 02:07:05,958
回去以後
垂斯克會叫我們出列
When we get back Mr. Trask
is bringing us up
in front of the whole school.

1552
02:07:07,033 --> 02:07:08,830
「抓你的腳到火堆前」
Puttin' your feet
to the fire?

1553
02:07:09,669 --> 02:07:12,069
生活委員會召開的
特別會議
Special meeting of the
disciplinary committee.

1554
02:07:13,906 --> 02:07:15,168
你要怎麼說？
And what are you
gonna tell 'em?

1555
02:07:19,178 --> 02:07:20,839
我會找些話題
I don't know.
I'll think of somethin'.

1556
02:07:23,983 --> 02:07:27,384
查理，你怎麼會落單呢？
Charlie, why are you
all alone in this thing?

1557
02:07:29,255 --> 02:07:30,449
你爸爸在哪裡？
Where's your father?

1558
02:07:32,725 --> 02:07:33,714
走了
He left.

1559
02:07:35,461 --> 02:07:39,722
我以為你家的店是父母開的
誰是爸爸？
I thought it was a
mom-and-pop store.
Who's the pop?

1560
02:07:40,333 --> 02:07:41,459
我繼父
It's my stepfather.
Oh, yeah.

1561
02:07:47,006 --> 02:07:50,869
他怎麼不管這事？
他有毛病？
But why isn't
he in on this?
Somethin' wrong with him?

1562
02:07:52,078 --> 02:07:56,276
沒有
我們只是處不來而已
No, he's okay. We just...
We don't get along
very well.

1563
02:07:56,682 --> 02:07:57,671
為什麼？
Why not?

1564
02:07:59,819 --> 02:08:09,222
他是混球
倒也無妨
Because he's
an asshole.
Well, that's
all right, Charlie.

1565
02:08:11,430 --> 02:08:14,092
每家都有一個
Every family's
got one nowadays.

1566
02:08:43,928 --> 02:08:44,917
就這些？
That's it?

1567
02:08:45,663 --> 02:08:46,652
就這些
That's it.

1568
02:08:46,865 --> 02:08:49,663
保重
好，謝了
Take care of
yourself, kid.
All right, Manny.
Thanks.

1569
02:08:56,007 --> 02:08:57,269
不，我不開窗
No,
I'm not opening.

1570
02:08:59,611 --> 02:09:01,272
我痛恨道別
I hate goodbyes.

1571
02:09:03,681 --> 02:09:07,082
你不會有事吧？
So...
You'll be
all right, huh?

1572
02:09:08,953 --> 02:09:10,147
不會
I'll be fine.

1573
02:09:11,956 --> 02:09:12,945
那好
All right.

1574
02:09:16,628 --> 02:09:17,287
什麼玩意？
What's that?

1575
02:09:19,230 --> 02:09:20,697
預備鈴
That's first bell.

1576
02:09:22,634 --> 02:09:24,363
剛好夠我梳洗
Just got time
to get cleaned up.

1577
02:09:28,306 --> 02:09:29,637
我差點忘了
I almost forgot.

1578
02:09:34,512 --> 02:09:35,979
我還欠你錢
I owe you
some money.

1579
02:09:38,650 --> 02:09:42,116
三百塊
順利完工
$300.
Job well done.

1580
02:09:46,124 --> 02:09:49,116
需要推薦信的話，來找我
You ever need
any references, Charlie,
I'm your man.

1581
02:09:51,062 --> 02:09:52,051
謝謝，中校
Thanks, Colonel.

1582
02:09:59,537 --> 02:10:02,335
華特街十六號，過橋就到
16 Water Street.
Over the bridge.

1583
02:10:02,407 --> 02:10:03,601
我知道路
We'll find it.

1584
02:10:05,009 --> 02:10:05,998
再會，查理
Goodbye, Charlie.

1585
02:10:08,480 --> 02:10:09,469
再見，中校
Goodbye, Colonel.

1586
02:10:13,351 --> 02:10:14,340
來，查理
Come here, son.

1587
02:10:31,703 --> 02:10:32,829
好了，曼尼
Okay, Manny.

1588
02:11:47,245 --> 02:11:49,042
喬治…
George. George!

1589
02:12:28,486 --> 02:12:31,011
我召開這次會議
I called an open meeting
of this institution
this morning

1590
02:12:31,089 --> 02:12:34,547
因為上週二發生的事件
because the incident
that occurred this
Tuesday last

1591
02:12:34,626 --> 02:12:38,494
關係到我們全體
describes an issue
that concerns all of us.

1592
02:12:40,164 --> 02:12:41,688
那不是單純的塗鴨
Not an isolated case
of vandalism.

1593
02:12:42,433 --> 02:12:47,427
而是我們社會的病態表徵
What happened
is a symptom
of the sickness
of a society.

1594
02:12:48,573 --> 02:12:53,972
並與博德的立校精神…
嚴重衝突
A sickness which runs
counter to the principles
this school was founded on.

1595
02:12:55,980 --> 02:12:58,312
本校的畢業生中
A school among
whose graduates

1596
02:12:58,383 --> 02:13:03,047
兩個曾入主白宮
two have sat behind the
desk in the Oval O·ce,
in the White House.

1597
02:13:04,322 --> 02:13:07,257
博德的人掌管州政府
投資局
Baird men have
run State Departments
and investment houses,

1598
02:13:08,459 --> 02:13:11,455
興建百貨商場…
指導足球隊
founded department stores
and coached football teams.

1599
02:13:11,529 --> 02:13:14,987
我們的校友在印度僧舍…
Our alumni receive
their bulletins in
ashrams in India

1600
02:13:15,466 --> 02:13:18,333
及約旦皇宮中都有
我們被視為
「國家領袖的搖籃」
and in palaces in Jordan.
We are, in fact,
known around the world
as the cradle of this
country's leadership.

1601
02:13:23,541 --> 02:13:26,601
你怎麼會在這裡？
台上有沒有位子？
A beacon in the...
What are you doing here?
Got room for me
up there, Charlie?

1602
02:13:26,678 --> 02:13:29,943
今天
我們因受辱而蒙羞
But today we are bleeding
from disrespect.

1603
02:13:30,081 --> 02:13:32,413
應該有
幫我一把
Yeah, I guess so.
Blatant disrespect.
Give us a hand.

1604
02:13:33,284 --> 02:13:35,218
不尊重本校價值觀…
A disrespect
for our values,

1605
02:13:35,286 --> 02:13:38,688
也不尊重
我們的標準
and a disrespect
for our standards.

1606
02:13:39,290 --> 02:13:45,024
更不尊重博德傳統
為了護衛該傳統…
A disrespect for
the Baird tradition.
And, as the custodians
of that tradition,

1607
02:13:46,698 --> 02:13:48,632
今天我們齊聚一堂…
保衛它不受摧殘
we are here today
to protect each other
from those who threaten it.

1608
02:13:55,106 --> 02:13:56,630
這是哪位，西門先生？
Who is this, Mr. Simms?

1609
02:13:59,310 --> 02:14:01,301
法蘭克.史雷德先生
This is Mr. Frank Slade,

1610
02:14:01,913 --> 02:14:05,576
美國陸軍中校，退役
Lieutenant Colonel,
United States Army,
retired.

1611
02:14:06,551 --> 02:14:08,746
我代表查理父母出席
I'm here in place
of Charlie's parents.

1612
02:14:09,053 --> 02:14:10,042
抱歉？
Excuse me?

1613
02:14:10,655 --> 02:14:12,646
「代表他父母」
In loco parentis.

1614
02:14:14,659 --> 02:14:17,321
他們不能從奧勒岡趕來
They could not make
the trip from
Oregon today.

1615
02:14:17,995 --> 02:14:19,986
您和西門先生是什麼關係？
And what is your
relationship to Mr. Simms?

1616
02:14:20,998 --> 02:14:22,329
這是法庭嗎？
Is this a
courtroom?

1617
02:14:23,468 --> 02:14:25,663
是最接近法庭的安排
Closest thing
we could manage to it.

1618
02:14:25,737 --> 02:14:29,070
如果要發誓
我倒想和幾個人一起
Then if we're taking oaths,
there's a few people
I'd like to swear in.

1619
02:14:31,743 --> 02:14:34,405
在博德是不發誓的
There are no oaths
at Baird.

1620
02:14:35,012 --> 02:14:36,411
我們自律
We are all on our honor.

1621
02:14:39,016 --> 02:14:44,010
拉瑞和芬妮
是我很好的朋友
Larry and Franny Simms
are very dear,
close friends of mine.

1622
02:14:44,689 --> 02:14:47,681
他們拜託我來
They've asked me
to appear here on
Charlie's behalf.

1623
02:14:48,826 --> 02:14:49,815
行嗎？
Okay?

1624
02:14:52,697 --> 02:14:53,686
歡迎光臨
Happy to have you
with us, Colonel.

1625
02:14:59,453 --> 02:15:00,647
威利斯先生
Mr. Willis.

1626
02:15:03,257 --> 02:15:04,246
哪一位？
Which Mr. Willis?

1627
02:15:04,892 --> 02:15:12,961
喬治二世，先生
George, Junior, sir.
Yes.

1628
02:15:12,961 --> 02:15:18,595
你目睹了塗鴨事件的經過
是誰做的？
You were in a position
last Tuesday night
to see who committed
this act of vandalism.
Who was it?

1629
02:15:21,169 --> 02:15:24,502
嗯，我不曉得是誰
Well, I have an idea
who it was.

1630
02:15:24,572 --> 02:15:25,903
不曉得
No, not an idea,
Mr. Willis.

1631
02:15:25,974 --> 02:15:27,771
你看到或沒看到？
Did you see or
did you not see?
Well...

1632
02:15:34,048 --> 02:15:36,642
我沒戴隱形眼鏡
I didn't have
my contacts in.
Come on.

1633
02:15:45,526 --> 02:15:48,654
在圖書館的時候脫下的
I was in the library.
I'd taken my glasses off,

1634
02:15:48,730 --> 02:15:51,198
本來要再戴回去
and I was gonna put
my contacts back in.

1635
02:15:56,871 --> 02:15:58,133
我幫西門鎖門
Then I helped
Simms close up

1636
02:15:58,406 --> 02:16:00,874
之後，我們已經在外面了
and the next thing
I know, we're outside,

1637
02:16:01,542 --> 02:16:05,672
我聽到聲音…
and I hear
this sound and I

1638
02:16:05,747 --> 02:16:08,409
但是沒時間戴隱形眼鏡
didn't have any time
to put my contacts in.

1639
02:16:09,217 --> 02:16:11,685
在你有限的視力下你看到誰
Whom, with your
limited vision,
did you see?

1640
02:16:29,637 --> 02:16:31,628
我講過了，看不清楚
Like I say,
it was blurry.

1641
02:16:37,512 --> 02:16:39,503
沒戴眼鏡我看不到
I can't see
without my contacts.

1642
02:16:40,181 --> 02:16:42,513
你看到誰，威利斯先生？
What did you see,
Mr. Willis?

1643
02:16:42,850 --> 02:16:46,308
你是說，確定地？
What?
You mean definitively?

1644
02:16:46,387 --> 02:16:49,584
不要閃爍其詞
講清楚
Stop fencing with me,
Mr. Willis!
Tell me what you saw!

1645
02:16:55,396 --> 02:16:59,990
不要全信我的話
不過…
沒眼鏡，天又黑…
Now, don't hold me to this,
but no contacts, it's dark...

1646
02:17:02,336 --> 02:17:03,598
等等…
And everything, I mean...
Mr. Willis!

1647
02:17:08,209 --> 02:17:09,198
可能是…
Maybe...

1648
02:17:11,879 --> 02:17:13,870
哈瑞.海夫曼爾
Harry Havemeyer,

1649
02:17:14,482 --> 02:17:17,349
博德.波特
和吉米.詹姆森
Trent Potter and
Jimmy Jameson.

1650
02:17:21,756 --> 02:17:22,415
「可能」？
Maybe?

1651
02:17:22,890 --> 02:17:24,551
猜測而已，我盡力了
Ballpark, best guess.

1652
02:17:26,894 --> 02:17:28,885
能提供一點細節嗎？
Could you provide us
with some detaiI?

1653
02:17:32,233 --> 02:17:35,430
何不問查理？他站的更近
Why don't you ask Charlie?
I really think he was closer.

1654
02:17:44,712 --> 02:17:45,701
西門先生
Mr. Simms.
Yes.

1655
02:17:49,050 --> 02:17:50,711
你沒戴隱形眼鏡吧？
You don't wear contact lenses,
do you?

1656
02:17:51,853 --> 02:17:52,842
沒有，先生
No, sir.

1657
02:17:54,922 --> 02:17:56,913
在你無礙的視野內
With your
untrammeled sight,

1658
02:17:57,992 --> 02:17:58,856
你看到誰了？
w£om did you see?

1659
02:18:03,197 --> 02:18:05,290
我是看到一些人
Well, I saw something,

1660
02:18:06,868 --> 02:18:09,769
但不能講是誰
but I couldn't say who.

1661
02:18:09,871 --> 02:18:12,772
你看到的是什麼？
All right. What was
the something you saw?

1662
02:18:16,878 --> 02:18:17,867
我不能說
I couldn't say.

1663
02:18:17,945 --> 02:18:19,810
不能說或不想說？
You couldn't or wouldn't say?

1664
02:18:22,617 --> 02:18:24,482
不，我只是…
Well, I just...

1665
02:18:28,222 --> 02:18:30,747
我不能說
不能、不想、不該
I just couldn't say.
Couldn't, wouldn't, shouldn't.

1666
02:18:31,025 --> 02:18:34,620
你磨盡我的耐性
還愚弄了大家
You're exhausting my patience
and making a mockery
of these proceedings.

1667
02:18:34,829 --> 02:18:38,788
我給你最後一次機會
西門先生
I will give you
one last chance.
The consequences
of your response
will be dire.

1668
02:18:38,866 --> 02:18:43,735
你的回答將決定你的未來
By dire, I mean
your future will be
jeopardized permanently.

1669
02:18:44,972 --> 02:18:46,633
現在，最後一次問你…
Now for the last time,

1670
02:18:46,841 --> 02:18:51,278
上週二晚上你看到誰在停車場
w£at did you see
last Tuesday night
outside my office?

1671
02:18:55,316 --> 02:18:56,374
我看到某些人
I saw somebody.

1672
02:18:57,251 --> 02:18:59,583
「我看到某些人」，好
"I saw somebody." Good.

1673
02:19:00,521 --> 02:19:02,284
看到他們的身材面貌了？
Did you see their
size and shape?
Yeah.

1674
02:19:06,460 --> 02:19:08,690
是誰的身材，面貌？
And they were the size
and shape of whom?

1675
02:19:14,669 --> 02:19:16,933
那些特徵…
They were the size and shape

1676
02:19:31,819 --> 02:19:33,810
看來像任何博德學生
先生
of most any
Baird student, sir.

1677
02:19:49,036 --> 02:19:51,698
我竟沒有一個證人！
I am left with
no real witness.

1678
02:19:53,174 --> 02:19:56,610
威利斯先生的證詞
模糊不清
Mr. Willis' testimony
is not only vague,
it is unsubstantiated.

1679
02:19:56,677 --> 02:19:59,840
我所尋找的線索
西門先生
The substance I was
looking for, Mr. Simms,

1680
02:19:59,914 --> 02:20:01,905
應該來自於你
was to come from you.

1681
02:20:05,486 --> 02:20:06,817
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1682
02:20:08,456 --> 02:20:10,447
我也很抱歉，西門先生
我既不能處罰…
海夫曼爾先生、波特先生
或詹姆森先生
I'm sorry, too, Mr. Simms,
because you know
what I'm going to do
inasmuch as I can't
punish Mr. Havemeyer
Mr. Potter or Mr. Jameson?

1683
02:20:18,366 --> 02:20:20,357
我也不會處罰威利斯先生
And I won't punish
Mr. Willis.

1684
02:20:21,035 --> 02:20:25,699
他是唯一配稱
「博德人」的份子
He's the only party
to this incident
w£o is still worthy
of calling himself
a Baird man.

1685
02:20:27,241 --> 02:20:30,233
我將建議生活委員會…
I'm going to recommend to
the disciplinary committee

1686
02:20:32,179 --> 02:20:33,441
開除你
that you be expelled.

1687
02:20:34,315 --> 02:20:38,282
你隱瞞真相…
又撒謊
Mr. Simms, you are
a cover-up artist
and you are a liar.

1688
02:20:38,519 --> 02:20:40,384
但不出賣朋友
But not a snitch!

1689
02:20:41,922 --> 02:20:43,116
請你重覆一遍
Excuse me?

1690
02:20:43,591 --> 02:20:44,922
我說得很清楚
No, I don't think
I will.
Mr. Slade.

1691
02:20:46,527 --> 02:20:49,519
這場聽證會簡直是胡鬧
This is such
a crock of shit!

1692
02:20:50,631 --> 02:20:52,496
請小心措詞
Please watch
your language, Mr. Slade.

1693
02:20:52,633 --> 02:20:55,625
你身在博德，不是軍營
You are in the Baird school,
not a barracks.

1694
02:20:56,337 --> 02:20:58,737
西門先生
我給你最後機會
Mr. Simms, I will
give you one final
opportunity to speak up.

1695
02:20:58,939 --> 02:21:01,066
西門先生不需要
Mr. Simms
doesn't want it.

1696
02:21:01,942 --> 02:21:05,935
他不需要被帖上
「博德人」標誌
He doesn't need
to be labeled
"still worthy of
being a Baird man."

1697
02:21:06,280 --> 02:21:08,077
這算什麼？
What the hell is that?

1698
02:21:08,416 --> 02:21:10,281
你們的座右銘是什麼？
What is your motto here?

1699
02:21:10,551 --> 02:21:14,453
「孩子們，出賣朋友求自保」
"Boys, inform on
your classmates,
save your hide,

1700
02:21:14,555 --> 02:21:17,353
「否則讓你屍骨無存」
"anything short of that,
we're gonna burn you
at the stake?"

1701
02:21:18,159 --> 02:21:20,150
先生們…
Well, gentlemen,

1702
02:21:20,428 --> 02:21:25,422
出紕漏時
有人跑，有人留
when the shit hits the fan,
some guys run,
and some guys stay.

1703
02:21:25,633 --> 02:21:27,760
查理面對困難
那邊的喬治卻躲進老爹的口袋裡
Here's Charlie,
facin' the fire,
and there's George,
hidin' in big daddy's pocket.

1704
02:21:31,705 --> 02:21:33,366
結果你做什麼呢？
And what are you doin'?

1705
02:21:33,441 --> 02:21:37,571
你獎勵喬治，開除查理
You're gonna reward George
and destroy Charlie.

1706
02:21:39,180 --> 02:21:40,442
你講完了，史先生？
Are you finished,
Mr. Slade?

1707
02:21:40,648 --> 02:21:43,116
不，我才剛暖好身
No, I'm just gettin'
warmed up.

1708
02:21:43,918 --> 02:21:50,713
我不知道誰念過博德
威廉塔夫脫、威廉布萊恩…
威廉泰爾…等等
I don't know
who went to
this place.
William Howard Taft,
William Jennings Bryan,
William Tell, whoever.

1709
02:21:50,791 --> 02:21:55,125
他們精神已死
就算曾有現在也沒了
Their spirit is dead,
if they ever had one.
It's gone.

1710
02:21:55,529 --> 02:21:57,861
你在這裡培育的是老鼠大隊
You're buildin'
a rat ship here,

1711
02:21:58,532 --> 02:22:01,126
一堆賣友求榮的告密者
a vessel for
seagoin' snitches.

1712
02:22:01,535 --> 02:22:05,198
如果你以為在鍛煉
蝦兵成龍頭
And if you think
you're preparin' these
minnows for manhood,

1713
02:22:05,272 --> 02:22:06,603
你最好三思
you better think again,

1714
02:22:06,874 --> 02:22:09,604
因為你正扼殺了…
because I say you are
killin' the very spirit

1715
02:22:09,810 --> 02:22:12,210
這所學府所堅持的精神
this institution
proclaims it instills.

1716
02:22:14,014 --> 02:22:15,345
真是恥辱
What a sham.

1717
02:22:15,683 --> 02:22:18,618
你們今天給我看的是什麼秀？
What kind of a show
are you guys puttin'
on here today?

1718
02:22:18,686 --> 02:22:22,213
唯一有格調的人
坐在我旁邊！
The only class
in this act is
sittin' next to me.

1719
02:22:22,289 --> 02:22:25,952
我可以告訴你
這孩子的靈魂沒有被污染
And I'm here
to tell you this boy's
soul is intact.

1720
02:22:26,026 --> 02:22:28,756
而且無庸置疑
為什麼我知道？
It's non-negotiable.
You know how I know?

1721
02:22:28,829 --> 02:22:32,356
這裡有人…我不說他是誰
要收買他
Someone here,
and I won't say who,
offered to buy it.

1722
02:22:33,300 --> 02:22:36,030
但查理不為所動
你太過份了
Only Charlie
here wasn't sellin'.
Sir, you're
out of order.

1723
02:22:36,237 --> 02:22:38,569
我告訴你什麼叫過份
I'd show you
out of order.

1724
02:22:38,973 --> 02:22:41,635
你根本不知道什麼叫過份
You don't know what
out of order is,
Mr. Trask.

1725
02:22:41,709 --> 02:22:46,578
我很想示範
但我太老、太累又瞎了
I'd show you,
but I'm too old,
I'm too tired,
I'm too fuckin' blind.

1726
02:22:46,847 --> 02:22:55,247
如果是五年前
我會帶火焰噴射槍來這兒！
If I were the man I was
five years ago, I'd take
a flamethrower to this place!

1727
02:22:55,247 --> 02:22:57,909
你以為你在跟誰說話？
Out of order? Who the hell
you think you're talkin' to?

1728
02:22:59,918 --> 02:23:02,250
我是見過世面的
明白嗎？
I've been around, you know?

1729
02:23:02,721 --> 02:23:05,451
有一度，我還看得見…
There was a time
I could see.

1730
02:23:05,524 --> 02:23:09,858
我見過很多更年輕的男孩
And I have seen.
Boys like these,
younger than these,

1731
02:23:10,062 --> 02:23:13,657
臂膀被扭斷，雙腿被炸斷
their arms torn out,
their legs ripped off.

1732
02:23:13,932 --> 02:23:18,869
但那些都不及醜陋的靈魂可怕
But there is nothin'
like the sight
of an amputated spirit.

1733
02:23:18,937 --> 02:23:22,464
靈魂不可能有義肢
There is no prosthetic
for that.

1734
02:23:23,609 --> 02:23:25,543
你以為你只是…
把這好青年
像落荒狗似的送回家
You think you're merely
sendin' this splendid
foot soldier
back home to Oregon with
his tail between his legs,

1735
02:23:30,482 --> 02:23:34,475
我說你是處死了他的靈魂
but I say you are
executin' his soul!

1736
02:23:35,621 --> 02:23:36,952
為什麼？
And why?

1737
02:23:37,890 --> 02:23:40,222
因為他不是博德人
Because he's not
a Baird man.

1738
02:23:40,893 --> 02:23:42,224
博德人
傷了這男孩，你就是博德孬種
Baird men.
You hurt this boy,
you're gonna be Baird bums,
the lot of you.

1739
02:23:46,832 --> 02:23:48,959
而哈瑞、吉米、博德…
And, Harry, Jimmy,

1740
02:23:49,968 --> 02:23:52,232
不管你們坐在哪裡…
Trent, wherever you are
out there,

1741
02:23:52,571 --> 02:23:53,765
去你媽的！
fuck you, too!

1742
02:23:56,975 --> 02:23:58,704
坐下，史雷德先生
Stand down, Mr. Slade!

1743
02:23:58,844 --> 02:24:00,835
我還沒講完
I'm not finished.

1744
02:24:01,513 --> 02:24:03,504
來這兒的時候…
我聽到類似
「領袖搖籃」的字眼
As I came in here,
I heard those words,
"cradle of leadership."

1745
02:24:09,054 --> 02:24:12,717
當支幹斷掉時
搖籃就垮了
它已經垮了，已經垮了
Well, "when the bough breaks,
the cradle will fall,"
and it has fallen here.
It has fallen.

1746
02:24:16,195 --> 02:24:19,187
人類製造者、領袖創造家
Makers of men,
creators of leaders.

1747
02:24:19,264 --> 02:24:22,461
當心你創造的是哪種領袖
Be careful what
kind of leaders
you're producin' here.

1748
02:24:23,602 --> 02:24:24,591
我不知道…
查理今天的緘默是對是錯
I don't know if Charlie's
silence here today
is right or wrong.
I'm not a judge orjury.

1749
02:24:29,474 --> 02:24:31,135
但我可以告訴你…
But I can tell you this,

1750
02:24:31,343 --> 02:24:35,143
他絕不會出賣別人
以求前程
he won't sell anybody out
to buy his future!

1751
02:24:36,348 --> 02:24:39,681
朋友們，這就叫正直
And that, my friends,
is called integrity.

1752
02:24:40,485 --> 02:24:41,952
也叫勇氣
That's called courage.

1753
02:24:42,487 --> 02:24:45,820
那才是領袖的要件
Now that's the stuff
leaders should be made of.

1754
02:24:51,230 --> 02:24:54,893
每次我走到人生十字路口
Now I have come to
the crossroads in my life.

1755
02:24:55,901 --> 02:24:59,564
我總是知道哪條路是對的
I always knew what
the right path was.

1756
02:25:00,172 --> 02:25:02,367
毫無例外，我就知道
但我從不走，為什麼？
Without exception, I knew,
but I never took it.
You know why?

1757
02:25:06,111 --> 02:25:08,773
因為那他媽的太苦了
It was too damn hard.

1758
02:25:10,782 --> 02:25:13,774
而現在查理
他也走到了十字路口
Now here's Charlie.
He's come to
the crossroads.

1759
02:25:14,052 --> 02:25:18,045
他選擇了對的路
He has chosen a path.
It's the right path.

1760
02:25:18,457 --> 02:25:22,450
一條磨練領袖個性的道路
It's a path made of principle
that leads to character.

1761
02:25:25,063 --> 02:25:27,395
讓他繼續他的行程吧
Let him continue
on his journey.

1762
02:25:29,668 --> 02:25:33,331
他的未來掌握在您手中
委員們
You hold this boy's future
in your hands, committee.

1763
02:25:34,339 --> 02:25:36,330
那是個價值連城的未來
It's a valuable future,

1764
02:25:37,075 --> 02:25:38,064
相信我
believe me.

1765
02:25:39,077 --> 02:25:41,739
別毀了它，保護它
Don't destroy it.
Protect it.

1766
02:25:43,415 --> 02:25:44,746
擁抱它
Embrace it.

1767
02:25:45,617 --> 02:25:48,950
我保證有一天您會引以為傲
It's gonna make you
proud one day,
I promise you.

1768
02:26:06,371 --> 02:26:08,032
很濫情吧？
How's that
for cornball?

1769
02:26:29,861 --> 02:26:31,852
摀不住他們嘴巴的，先生
Nothing can
shut them up, sir.

1770
02:26:36,335 --> 02:26:41,329
生活委員會將再開會討論此案
The disciplinary
committee will take
this matter under advisement
in closed session.

1771
02:26:49,815 --> 02:26:51,476
他們在幹嘛？
What are they doin',
Charlie?
I think they're
going to come to
a decision now.
Very well.

1772
02:27:06,031 --> 02:27:08,693
很顯然的，不必再開會了
Apparently, that meeting
will be unnecessary.

1773
02:27:09,768 --> 02:27:11,099
杭賽克太太
Mrs. Hunsaker.

1774
02:27:15,574 --> 02:27:20,443
生活委員會不必另行開會
The joint student-faculty
disciplinary committee
needs no further sessions.

1775
02:27:20,846 --> 02:27:22,837
他們已達成決議
They have come to a decision.

1776
02:27:23,582 --> 02:27:26,449
海夫曼爾、波特
及詹姆森先生
Messrs. Havemeyer,
Potter and Jameson

1777
02:27:26,518 --> 02:27:31,512

而留校查看
are placed on probation
for suspicion of
ungentlemanly conduct.

1778
02:27:31,790 --> 02:27:34,953
另外建議
喬治威利斯二世先生
It is further recommended
that Mr. George Willis, Jr.

1779
02:27:35,027 --> 02:27:40,363
不因其合作而做任何表揚或處分
Receive neither recognition
nor commendation
for his cooperation.

1780
02:27:41,666 --> 02:27:46,535
西門先生將不需
為此事件負責
Mr. Charles Simms is excused
from any further response
to this incident.
Hoo-ah!
Charlie!

1781
02:28:47,532 --> 02:28:50,865
小心！
有你在我很放心
Last step.
I can always count
on you, Charlie.

1782
02:28:54,606 --> 02:28:57,598
中校…
Colonel!

1783
02:28:59,544 --> 02:29:02,877
我是克莉絲汀.唐伊
政治學教授
I'm Christine Downes,
Colonel Slade.
I teach
political science.

1784
02:29:03,148 --> 02:29:06,481
非常感謝您的高見
I wanted to tell you
how much I appreciate
you speaking your mind.

1785
02:29:06,551 --> 02:29:07,950
謝謝，你結婚了？
Why, thank you.
Are you married?
I...

1786
02:29:13,491 --> 02:29:17,086
我在炮兵課的同學
也姓唐伊
Went to an artillery school
at Fort Sill with
a Mickey Downes.

1787
02:29:17,162 --> 02:29:18,220
我以為他釣上你了
Thought he might've
snagged you.

1788
02:29:18,897 --> 02:29:20,888
沒有呢
No, I'm afraid not.

1789
02:29:22,767 --> 02:29:25,964
史中校曾是詹森的幕僚
Colonel Slade was on
Lyndon Johnson's staff,
Miss Downes.

1790
02:29:26,705 --> 02:29:28,764
真的？太精彩了
Were you? Fascinating.

1791
02:29:29,040 --> 02:29:31,565
有空我們應該聊聊政治
We should get together,
talk politics sometime.

1792
02:29:35,513 --> 02:29:36,707
芙洛兒.狄蘿卡里絲香水
Fleurs de Rocaille.

1793
02:29:39,184 --> 02:29:40,173

「小溪之花」
"Flowers from a brook."

1795
02:29:45,590 --> 02:29:46,921
對
That's right.

1796
02:29:51,062 --> 02:29:54,463
唐伊小姐
我知道到哪找你
Well, Miss Downes,
I'll know where to find you.
Charlie.
Bye, Miss Downes.
Bye.

1797
02:30:04,275 --> 02:30:06,266
你不必告訴我
You don't have to
tell me, Charlie.

1798
02:30:07,345 --> 02:30:08,676
五尺七

呀吧嗒吧嘟！
Yabba-dabba-doo.
Manny.

1802
02:30:44,316 --> 02:30:45,647
太多了
Colonel, this
is too much.

1803
02:30:45,718 --> 02:30:50,121
你應得的
下次查理和我去紐約時
會再找你，你帶我們來回
Never mind,
you earned it.
Next time Charlie and I
want to take a
breather to New York,
we're gonna call you.
You can drive us
both ways.

1804
02:30:53,793 --> 02:30:57,991
沒問題，中校，我的榮幸
我給您打折
You're on,
Colonel.
Not only will it
be an honor,
I'll give you
a rate.

1805
02:30:58,264 --> 02:30:59,458
我再加倍給小費
I'll see your rate
and raise you.

1806
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:02,797
保重
Stay outta
harm's way, Manny.

1807
02:31:03,002 --> 02:31:04,993
保重，中校
你也一樣
Take care,
Colonel.
You, too.

1808
02:31:06,472 --> 02:31:08,463
不，謝了，我自己走
Ready?
No. I'll take it
from here.

1809
02:31:09,742 --> 02:31:13,075
走吧，曼尼會送你回宿舍
You go on ahead.
Manny'll drive you
to your dorm.

1810
02:31:14,814 --> 02:31:18,341
聖誕節前再來
咱倆喝一杯
Come by before you
go home for Christmas.
We'll have a little cheer.

1811
02:31:19,752 --> 02:31:22,084
你要是願意，就留下晚餐
And if you like,
stay for dinner.

1812
02:31:22,288 --> 02:31:26,622
有時候她做燒雞
還能入口
Sometimes she cooks
a pot roast.
It's almost edible.

1813
02:31:28,494 --> 02:31:29,825
好，中校
All right, Colonel.
That'd be really...

1814
02:31:30,696 --> 02:31:31,890
那會是…
再見，查理
Bye, Charlie.

1815
02:31:52,518 --> 02:31:53,849
是誰？
是你嗎，法蘭絲？
Who's there?
That you, Francine?
Yes.

1816
02:31:57,323 --> 02:32:00,315
你在做什麼？
騎車
What are you doing?
Taking a ride.

1817
02:32:00,526 --> 02:32:03,791
讓我搭便車吧？
Taking a ride?
What about you
giving me a lift?

1818
02:32:04,864 --> 02:32:05,592
不要
No.

1819
02:32:06,065 --> 02:32:07,054
不要？
No?

1820
02:32:07,666 --> 02:32:13,061
拜託嘛，法蘭絲
我們重歸於好嘛
你不想跟我和我？
Come on, Francine.
We should make up.
Don't you think
it's time we made up?

1821
02:32:13,672 --> 02:32:14,536
不想
No.
Francine?
What?

1822
02:32:16,475 --> 02:32:22,478
你法蘭克叔公過了一個
很辛苦的…
感恩節週末
Uncle Frank's had
a really hard
Thanksgiving weekend.

1823
02:32:23,549 --> 02:32:24,208
那是什麼？
我聽到花栗鼠
還是海象？
What's that?
I hear a chipmunk.
Is it a walrus?

1824
02:32:28,954 --> 02:32:30,285
都不是，是威利
No, it's Willie.

1825
02:32:30,823 --> 02:32:38,689
要不要幫我拿提袋？
來嘛！乖
來吧
Willie, why don't you
help me with my bag?
Come on, son.
Help me with my bag.
Come on. Come on.

1826
02:32:39,098 --> 02:32:41,896
拿好了？拿穩哦
走
You got it. Hold onto it.
You're strong. Come on.
Here we are.

1827
02:32:47,773 --> 02:32:50,105
跟我和威利來
Francine, come on
with me and Willie.

1828
02:32:50,643 --> 02:32:54,443
你可以請我吃巧克力
好不好
I'll let you make me
some marshmallow
chocolate.
What do you say?
Good!
